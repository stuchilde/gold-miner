# Debugging Swift code with LLDB

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*_o1ATofHFOE2zlbbPSFz-Q.png)

As engineers we spend almost 70% of our time on debugging. The rest 20% goes on thinking about the architectural approaches + communication with teammates and just 10% actually on writing code.

> Debugging is like being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer.
>
> ‚Äî [Filipe Fortes](https://twitter.com/fortes) via Twitter

So it‚Äôs extremely important to make this 70% of our time as pleasant as possible. LLDB comes to rescue. Fancy Xcode Debugger UI shows you all available information without typing a single LLDB command. However, the console is still a big part of our workflow. Let‚Äôs break down some of the most useful LLDB tricks. I personally use them daily for debugging.

### Where should we go first?

LLDB is an enormous tool and it has a lot of useful commands inside. I won‚Äôt describe them all. I‚Äôd like to walk you through the most useful commands instead. So here is our plan:

1. Explore variables values: `expression`, `e`, `print`, `po`, `p`
2. Get overall app‚Äôs state + language specific commands: `bugreport`, `frame`, `language`
3. Control app‚Äôs execution flow: `process`, `breakpoint`, `thread`, `watchpoint`
4. Honorable mentions: `command`, `platform`, `gui`

I have also prepared the map of useful LLDB commands with description and examples. If you need you can hang it above your Mac to remember these commands üôÇ

Download full size version with this link‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää[https://www.dropbox.com/s/9sv67e7f2repbpb/lldb-commands-map.png?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9sv67e7f2repbpb/lldb-commands-map.png?dl=0)

### 1. Explore variables value and state

Commands: `expression`, `e`, `print`, `po`, `p`

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*HcuIHN3WucfxG2Mk80wldw.png)

The basic function of a debugger is to explore and modify variables‚Äô values. This is what `expression` or `e` is made for (and much more actually). You can evaluate basically any expression or command in a runtime.

Let‚Äôs assume you‚Äôre debugging some function `valueOfLifeWithoutSumOf()` which do a summation of two numbers and extract the result from 42.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ZRG-coIMk9udSc4edkMO6w.png)

Let‚Äôs also assume you keep getting the wrong answer and you don‚Äôt know why. So to find a problem you can do something like this:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*LOFplcSqjYiO2BAjPi--4A.png)

Or‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs better to use LLDB expression instead to change the value in the runtime. And find out where the problem has happened. First, set a breakpoint to a place you interested in. Then run your app.

To print the value of specific variable in LLDB format you should call:

```
(lldb) e <variable>
```

And the very same command is used to evaluate some expression:

```
(lldb) e <expression>
```

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*MCBw_pKgO2N5uPZKYmS0fQ.png)

```
(lldb) e sum 
(Int) $R0 = 6 // You can also use $R0 to refer to this variable in the future (during current debug session)

(lldb) e sum = 4 // Change value of sum variable

(lldb) e sum 
(Int) $R2 = 4 // sum variable will be "4" till the end of debugging session
```

`expression` command also has some flags. To distinct flags and actual expression LLDB uses double-dash notation `--` after `expression` command like this:

```
(lldb) expression <some flags> -- <variable>
```

`expression` has almost ~30 different flags. And I encourage you to explore them all. Write the command below in the terminal to get full documentation:

```
> lldb
> (lldb) help # To explore all available commands
> (lldb) help expression # To explore all expressions related sub-commands
```

I‚Äôd like to stop on the following `expression`'s flags:

* `-D <count>` (`--depth <count>`)‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäSet the max recurse depth when dumping aggregate types (default is infinity).
* `-O` (`--object-description`)‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäDisplay using a language-specific description API, if possible.
* `-T` (`--show-types`)‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäShow variable types when dumping values.
* `-f <format>` (`--format <format>`) ‚Äì‚Äì Specify a format to be used for display.
* `-i <boolean>` (`--ignore-breakpoints <boolean>`)‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäIgnore breakpoint hits while running expressions

Let‚Äôs say we have some object called `logger`. This object contains some string and structure as properties. For example, you want to explore first-level properties only. Just use `-D` flag with appropriate depth level to do so:

```
(lldb) e -D 1 -- logger

(LLDB_Debugger_Exploration.Logger) $R5 = 0x0000608000087e90 {
  currentClassName = "ViewController"
  debuggerStruct ={...}
}
```

By default LLDB will look infinitely into the object and show you a full description of every nested object:

```
(lldb) e -- logger

(LLDB_Debugger_Exploration.Logger) $R6 = 0x0000608000087e90 {
  currentClassName = "ViewController"
  debuggerStruct = (methodName = "name", lineNumber = 2, commandCounter = 23)
}
```

You can also explore object description with `e -O --` or simply using alias `po` like in the example below:

```
(lldb) po logger

<Logger: 0x608000087e90>
```

Not so descriptive, isn‚Äôt it? To get human-readable description you have to apply your custom class to `CustomStringConvertible` protocol and implement `var description: String { return ...}` property. Only then `po` returns you readable description.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*v1JRHrSQmGIOkEUiQ5CZXA.png)

At the beginning of this section, I‚Äôve also mentioned `print` command.
Basically `print <expression/variable>` is the same as `expression -- <expression/variable>`. Except `print` command doesn‚Äôt take any flags or additional arguments.

### 2. Get overall app‚Äôs state + language specific commands

`bugreport`, `frame`, `language`

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*1OpRvgpxYDjA5ZeEpbh55Q.png)

How often have you copied and pasted and paste crash logs into your task manager to explore the issue later? LLDB has this great little command called `bugreport` which will generate a full report of current app‚Äôs state. It could be really helpful if you encounter some problem but want to tackle it a bit later. In order to restore your understand of app‚Äôs state, you can use `bugreport` generated report.

```
(lldb) bugreport unwind --outfile <path to output file>
```

The final report will look like example on the screenshot below:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*ziOW_lKhI6cBgGHl204kDg.png)

Example of `bugreport` command output.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*05j2Rp0t2hWAHsCW3tReqg.png)

Let‚Äôs say you want to get a quick overview of the current stack frame in current thread. `frame` command can help you with that:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*nAyd2l2m679XpH_In968YQ.png)

Use snippet below to get a quick understanding where you are and what surrounding conditions are at the moment:

```
(lldb) frame info

frame #0: 0x000000010bbe4b4d LLDB-Debugger-Exploration`ViewController.valueOfLifeWithoutSumOf(a=2, b=2, self=0x00007fa0c1406900) -> Int at ViewController.swift:96
```

This information will be useful in breakpoint management later in the article.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*uLXBPbMvpDGU3Y9ElPQPsA.png)

LLDB has a couple of commands for a specific language. There are commands for C++, Objective-C, Swift and RenderScript. In this case, we‚Äôre interested in Swift. So here are these two commands: `demangle` and `refcount`.

`demangle` as written in its name just demangle mangled Swift type name (which Swift generates during compilation to avoid namespace problem). If you‚Äôd like to learn more on that I‚Äôd suggest you watch this WWDC14 session‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää[‚ÄúAdvanced Swift Debugging in LLDB‚Äù](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2014/410/).

`refcount` is also a pretty straightforward command. It shows you reference count for the specific object. Let‚Äôs see the output example with an object we used in the previous section‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää`logger`:

```
(lldb) language swift refcount logger

refcount data: (strong = 4, weak = 0)
```

For sure, this could be quite useful if you are debugging some memory leaks.

### 3. Control app‚Äôs execution flow

`process`, `breakpoint`, `thread`

This part is my favorite. Because using these command from LLDB (`breakpoint` command in particular) you can automate a lot of routine stuff during debugging. Which eventually speed up your debugging process a lot.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*mLGvusUvwDjWnuRGIaM6zw.png)

With `process` you can basically control debug process and attach to a specific target or detach a debugger from it. But since Xcode does the process attachment for us automatically (LLDB is attached by Xcode every time you run a target) I won‚Äôt stop on that. You can read how to attach to a target using terminal in this Apple guide‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää[‚ÄúUsing LLDB as a Standalone Debugger‚Äù](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/gdb_to_lldb_transition_guide/document/lldb-terminal-workflow-tutorial.html).

Using `process status` you can explore a current place where the debugger is waiting for you:

```
(lldb) process status

Process 27408 stopped
* thread #1, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = step over
frame #0: 0x000000010bbe4889 LLDB-Debugger-Exploration`ViewController.viewDidLoad(self=0x00007fa0c1406900) -> () at ViewController.swift:69
66
67           let a = 2, b = 2
68           let result = valueOfLifeWithoutSumOf(a, and: b)
-> 69           print(result)
70
71
72
```

In order to continue execution of the target until the next breakpoint occur, run this command:

```
(lldb) process continue

(lldb) c // Or just type "c" which is the same as previous command
```

It‚Äôs the equivalent of ‚Äúcontinue‚Äù button in the Xcode debugger toolbar:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*gv020i3Uihl0JCxg4D6FyQ.png)

`breakpoint` command allows you to manipulate breakpoints in any possible way. Let‚Äôs skip the most obvious commands like: `breakpoint enable`, `breakpoint disable` and `breakpoint delete`.

First things first, to explore all your breakpoints let‚Äôs use `list` sub-command like in the example below:

```
(lldb) breakpoint list

Current breakpoints:
1: file = '/Users/Ahmed/Desktop/Recent/LLDB-Debugger-Exploration/LLDB-Debugger-Exploration/ViewController.swift', line = 95, exact_match = 0, locations = 1, resolved = 1, hit count = 1

1.1: where = LLDB-Debugger-Exploration`LLDB_Debugger_Exploration.ViewController.valueOfLifeWithoutSumOf (Swift.Int, and : Swift.Int) -> Swift.Int + 27 at ViewController.swift:95, address = 0x0000000107f3eb3b, resolved, hit count = 1

2: file = '/Users/Ahmed/Desktop/Recent/LLDB-Debugger-Exploration/LLDB-Debugger-Exploration/ViewController.swift', line = 60, exact_match = 0, locations = 1, resolved = 1, hit count = 1

2.1: where = LLDB-Debugger-Exploration`LLDB_Debugger_Exploration.ViewController.viewDidLoad () -> () + 521 at ViewController.swift:60, address = 0x0000000107f3e609, resolved, hit count = 1
```

The first number in the list is a breakpoint ID which you can use to refer to any specific breakpoint. Let‚Äôs set some new breakpoint right from the console:

```
(lldb) breakpoint set -f ViewController.swift -l 96

Breakpoint 3: where = LLDB-Debugger-Exploration`LLDB_Debugger_Exploration.ViewController.valueOfLifeWithoutSumOf (Swift.Int, and : Swift.Int) -> Swift.Int + 45 at ViewController.swift:96, address = 0x0000000107f3eb4d
```

In this example `-f` is a name of the file where you‚Äôd like to put a breakpoint. And `-l` is a line number of a new breakpoint. There is a shorter way to set the very same breakpoint with `b` shortcut:

```
(lldb) b ViewController.swift:96
```

You can also set a breakpoint with a specific regex (function name, for example) using the command below:

```
(lldb) breakpoint set --func-regex valueOfLifeWithoutSumOf

(lldb) b -r valueOfLifeWithoutSumOf // Short version of the command above
```

It‚Äôs sometimes useful to set a breakpoint for only one hit. And then instruct the breakpoint to delete itself right away. For sure, there is a flag for that:

```
(lldb) breakpoint set --one-shot -f ViewController.swift -l 90

(lldb) br s -o -f ViewController.swift -l 91 // Shorter version of the command above
```

Now let‚Äôs tackle the most interesting part‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbreakpoint automation. Did you know you can set a specific action which will execute as soon as breakpoint occurs? Yes, you can! Do you use `print()` in the code to explore values you‚Äôre interested in for debugging? Please don‚Äôt do that, there is a better way. üôÇ

With `breakpoint command`, you can setup commands which will execute right when the breakpoint is hit. You can even make ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù breakpoints which won‚Äôt interrupt execution. Well, technically these ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù breakpoints will interrupt execution but you won‚Äôt notice it if you add `continue` command at the end of commands chain.

```
(lldb) b ViewController.swift:96 // Let's add a breakpoint first

Breakpoint 2: where = LLDB-Debugger-Exploration`LLDB_Debugger_Exploration.ViewController.valueOfLifeWithoutSumOf (Swift.Int, and : Swift.Int) -> Swift.Int + 45 at ViewController.swift:96, address = 0x000000010c555b4d

(lldb) breakpoint command add 2 // Setup some commands 

Enter your debugger command(s).  Type 'DONE' to end.
> p sum // Print value of "sum" variable
> p a + b // Evaluate a + b
> DONE
```

To ensure you‚Äôve added correct commands use `breakpoint command list <breakpoint id>` sub-command:

<pre name="17bc" id="17bc" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">(lldb) breakpoint command list 2</pre>

```
(lldb) breakpoint command list 2

Breakpoint 2:
Breakpoint commands:
p sum
p a + b
```

Next time when this breakpoint hit we‚Äôll get the following output in the console:

```
Process 36612 resuming
p sum
(Int) $R0 = 6

p a + b
(Int) $R1 = 4
```

Great! Exactly what we‚Äôre looking for. You can make it even smoother by adding `continue` command at the end of the commands chain. So you won‚Äôt even stop on this breakpoint.

```
(lldb) breakpoint command add 2 // Setup some commands

Enter your debugger command(s).  Type 'DONE' to end.
> p sum // Print value of "sum" variable
> p a + b // Evaluate a + b
> continue // Resume right after first hit
> DONE
```

So the result would be:

```
p sum
(Int) $R0 = 6

p a + b
(Int) $R1 = 4

continue
Process 36863 resuming
Command #3 'continue' continued the target.
```

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*Hd2VNOZsUZ2Lsmk_oznRig.png)

With `thread` command and its subcommands you can fully control execution flow: `step-over`, `step-in`, `step-out` and `continue`. These are direct equivalent of flow control buttons on Xcode debugger toolbar.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_CILKjcJsdVco-hG9rDmhg.png)

There is also a predefined LLDB shortcut for these particular commands:

```
(lldb) thread step-over
(lldb) next // The same as "thread step-over" command
(lldb) n // The same as "next" command

(lldb) thread step-in
(lldb) step // The same as "thread step-in"
(lldb) s // The same as "step"
```

In order to get more information about the current thread just call `info` subcommand:

```
(lldb) thread info 

thread #1: tid = 0x17de17, 0x0000000109429a90 LLDB-Debugger-Exploration`ViewController.sumOf(a=2, b=2, self=0x00007fe775507390) -> Int at ViewController.swift:90, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = step in
```

To see a list of all currently active threads use `list` subcommand:

```
(lldb) thread list

Process 50693 stopped

* thread #1: tid = 0x17de17, 0x0000000109429a90 LLDB-Debugger-Exploration`ViewController.sumOf(a=2, b=2, self=0x00007fe775507390) -> Int at ViewController.swift:90, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = step in

  thread #2: tid = 0x17df4a, 0x000000010daa4dc6  libsystem_kernel.dylib`kevent_qos + 10, queue = 'com.apple.libdispatch-manager'
  
  thread #3: tid = 0x17df4b, 0x000000010daa444e libsystem_kernel.dylib`__workq_kernreturn + 10

  thread #5: tid = 0x17df4e, 0x000000010da9c34a libsystem_kernel.dylib`mach_msg_trap + 10, name = 'com.apple.uikit.eventfetch-thread'
```

### Honorable mentions

`command`, `platform`, `gui`

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*X9Dl7gaVB1elSpD8WycZGA.png)

In the LLDB you can find a command for managing other commands. Sounds weird but in practice, it‚Äôs quite useful little tools. First, it allows you to execute some LLDB commands right from the file. So you can create a file with some useful commands and execute them at once as if it would be a single LLDB command. Here is a simple example of the file:

```
thread info // Show current thread info
br list // Show all breakpoints
```

And here is how the actual command looks like:

```
(lldb) command source /Users/Ahmed/Desktop/lldb-test-script

Executing commands in '/Users/Ahmed/Desktop/lldb-test-script'.

thread info
thread #1: tid = 0x17de17, 0x0000000109429a90 LLDB-Debugger-Exploration`ViewController.sumOf(a=2, b=2, self=0x00007fe775507390) -> Int at ViewController.swift:90, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = step in

br list
Current breakpoints:
1: file = '/Users/Ahmed/Desktop/Recent/LLDB-Debugger-Exploration/LLDB-Debugger-Exploration/ViewController.swift', line = 60, exact_match = 0, locations = 1, resolved = 1, hit count = 0
1.1: where = LLDB-Debugger-Exploration`LLDB_Debugger_Exploration.ViewController.viewDidLoad () -> () + 521 at ViewController.swift:60, address = 0x0000000109429609, resolved, hit count = 0
```

There is also a downside, unfortunately, you can‚Äôt pass any argument to the source file (unless you‚Äôll create a valid variable in the script file itself).

If you need something more advanced you can always use `script` sub-command. Which will allow you to manage (`add`, `delete`, `import` and `list`) custom Python scripts. With the `script` a real automation becomes possible. Please check out this nice guide on [Python scripting for LLDB](http://www.fabianguerra.com/ios/introduction-to-lldb-python-scripting/). Just for the demo, let‚Äôs create a script file _script.py_ and write a simple command _print_hello()_ which will just print ‚ÄúHello Debugger!‚Äù in the console:

```
import lldb

def print_hello(debugger, command, result, internal_dict):
	print "Hello Debugger!"
    
def __lldb_init_module(debugger, internal_dict):
	debugger.HandleCommand('command script add -f script.print_hello print_hello') // Handle script initialization and add command from this module
	print 'The "print_hello" python command has been installed and is ready for use.' // Print confirmation that everything works
```

Then we need to import a Python module and start using our script command normally:

```
(lldb) command import ~/Desktop/script.py

The "print_hello" python command has been installed and is ready for use.

(lldb) print_hello

Hello Debugger!
```

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*6fRizbW5TQ02_DzHnUinzg.png)

You can quickly check current platform information with a `status` subcommand. `status` will tell you: SDK path, processor architecture, OS version and even list of available devices for this SDK.

```
(lldb) platform status

Platform: ios-simulator
Triple: x86_64-apple-macosx
OS Version: 10.12.5 (16F73)

```

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*S914ih9-vrEoXKllCJpl0g.png)

Well, you can‚Äôt use LLDB GUI mode in the Xcode, but you can always do it from the terminal.

```
(lldb) gui

// You'll see this error if you try to execute gui command in Xcode
error: the gui command requires an interactive terminal.
```

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*iN9X46pAI6cDv-ZL5v4L-w.png)

This is how LLDB GUI mode looks like.

### Conclusion:

In this article, I just scratched the surface of true LLDB‚Äôs power. Even though LLDB here with us for ages, there are still many people who don‚Äôt use its full potential. I have made a quick overview of basic functions and how LLDB can automate debugging process. I hope it was useful.

So much LLDB functions were left behind. There are also some view debugging techniques which I didn‚Äôt even mention. If you are interested in such topic, please leave a comment below. I‚Äôd be more than happy to write about it.

I strongly encourage you to open a terminal, enable LLDB and just type `help`. This will show you a full documentation. And you can spend hours reading it. But I guarantee this would be a reasonable time investment. Because knowing your tools is the only way for engineers to become truly productive.
