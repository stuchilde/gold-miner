如果你曾经做过一些非常需要创造性的工作，那你应该很清楚在创作中遇到阻碍的感觉。这种感觉就像撞上南墙: _你想不到一个足够好的点子，或是你想到的点子根本无法在实际中应用。_

对于设计师们来说，这种感觉再熟悉不过了。然而，任何复杂的问题都没有那么容易解决，但一个聪明的工作流程就可以让这一切都变得不同。这就是为什么我们需要为用户体验设计绘制草图。

绘制草图是一个关键点，但它却常常在用户体验设计中被忽视。草图是一种表达设计的非常有效率的方式，设计师们可以通过草图来尝试许多不同的点子，而避免沉沦于其中的某一个。

在这篇文章中，我想要介绍为用户体验设计绘制草图时你所需要知道的一切，包括了下面这几点：

*   介绍用户体验设计中的草图与线框图
*   绘制草图的基本要点、工具以及技巧
*   用笔记、注释和数字来阐明你的草图
*   为用户体验设计绘制草图时的小提示
*   用简单的设计方法来提高质量和效率
*   关于线框流程图你所需要知道的一切
*   为用户体验流程绘制草图的快速指南

## 绘制草图是一个需要两步走的过程

在设计中你必须考虑许多不同的方案，确保最终选择和确定的结果是_最好的那一个。_ 设计师们在设计时应该先思考他们的不同方案，之后再着手于细节，因此用户体验设计应该是一个两步走的过程：

![Ux sketching](https://assets.toptal.io/uploads/blog/image/121222/toptal-blog-image-1474991007791-230ca06cc9fe1490e78fb46953ffbcb0.jpg)

在最初的设计过程中，你会产生许多不同的想法，但这些想法都很难成形，甚至有一些元素的残缺或丢失也不奇怪。最重要的事是你应该用不同的方法去思考，并判断哪一种在你的任务环境中最有效率，以及你的项目会遇到的各种限制。

*   **细节与精炼**

一步一步来。选定一些看上去不错的想法并且开始着手于优化他们的细节，以此来填补这些点子中不合适的部分。

## 用户体验设计中的草图和线框图：介绍与分类

你绘制的线框图很可能依据你的产品而有所不同，比如所需要的细节程度，颜色或风格的不同，或是你是否需要展示给某人，等等。

![](https://assets.toptal.io/uploads/blog/image/121204/toptal-blog-image-1474890673236-d74ae4998dab921752d271212847a991.png)

好的草图会让你的想法更清晰，找到最佳解决方案，并节省你的时间。

我列出了下面这些不同类型的草图:

* 草稿：提出构思

这些是最初的草图版本，用于指出较低程度的细节，色彩的使用范围也有限。

我会绘制大量简单的手绘图来以不同的角度思考问题和解决方案。当我绘制了足够多的手绘图，我也尽可能地去让这些解决方案发散开来。

在这个特别的步骤里，低完成度的要求使我放开了思想，因为要避免在这个阶段陷入一些细枝末节是非常重要的。我的目标是尽可能地想出许多的点子，并选择出最合适的哪一个。

* **线框图：规范的细化阶段**

在我选出一个最好的想法并有了大体的细节之后，我通常会挑选出合适的草图来继续细化。

但是，这么做_并不意味着要添加上每一个细节_。很显然，有些事只要标记一下就可以了。此外，有些东西也很难在纸上被详细描述。

在这一步中，我会画出所有_重要的细节_，但我还并不打算在[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)中绘制线框图。等我在纸上把所有事都做好之后，我再开始使用 Sketch 来绘制线框图。

> 数字化的工具相比于传统纸张，为创作提供了更广阔的自由空间。并且，你可以很轻易地把注意力放到微小的细节上。比如说，相比于设计，你可以把注意力集中于「像素级的改进」。

* 视觉设计稿

这看起来和上一步很接近，但许多时候它依然是很有帮助的。视觉设计稿解决的是帮助你在初期阶段来思考你的项目，但这也许会耗费你相当多的时间来把它们都在电脑上绘制出来。这也是为什么我首先在纸上绘制手绘稿，在思考了不同的方案之后再选择一个合适的视觉设计方向。

* **部件/元素分解**

我发现当我有了一个大体的想法，而我需要考虑某一个特定页面的功能或是界面中的必要组成部分时，这个技巧就是非常有用处的了。我会画出不同的页面元素，去深入它们的细节，然后在不同位置画出这些页面元素。

即便是最简单的一个元素，也一定会有它特定的状态；一个按钮可以被按下，一个文字框可以是空的也可以被填满。它的组成越复杂，那么它的状态也越多样。

![](https://assets.toptal.io/uploads/blog/image/121220/toptal-blog-image-1474978796798-825431fd42dbca2c9a78a5046003b9d7.png)

## 从最基础的开始

*   **准备好你的工具** - 尽可能找一个最方便你工作的地方，要有一张空间足够大的大桌子。多带上一些纸，再准备一些水笔和记号笔。
*   **热身** - 为了让你准备好开始我建议你画一些线条，圆形，基本模板和图标。
*   **明确你的目标** - 明确你想要画的是什么。 设定好你的目标并决定你想要讲一个什么样的故事。告诉自己是否已经做好准备大施拳脚。
*   **明确你的目标群体** - 如果你的草图是画给自己看，那你不需要介意你怎么去画这些图。但是如果你打算把你画的图给客户看，那你应该确保用一些额外的时间为你的草图添加更多细节。
*   **设定一个时间范围** - 决定一个时间段用来分配给绘图，让我们定个 30 分钟吧，这能帮助你专注于工作。

Now, you are all set and you can get started:

1.  **Draw the edges** - Draw the frames, a browser or phone window, a part of the interface, and so on.

2.  **Add the biggest or basic elements** - Menu, footer, main content.

3.  **Add details** - Add relevant details, but keep them simple at this stage.

4.  **Add annotations and notes** - These are required only if you’re planning to share the sketches. However, they can be useful even if you’re doing them for your eyes only.

5.  **Sketch alternatives** - Sketch some quick alternatives to your solution.

6.  **Pick the best solution** - Choose the best options.

7.  **Add shadow and bevel** - This is particularly important for sharing purposes. Add a shadow to make your sketch visually appealing, which is important if you plan to share it with team members and/or clients.

8.  **Save the sketch** - Take a photo or put it in a folder. I have a few paper trays on my table for sketches.

9.  **Share** - I usually use one of the following sharing methods:
    *   Scan sketches via [Evernote](https://evernote.com/?var=c) and provide a permalink to other team members or stakeholders.
    *   Take a photo and upload to [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/).
    *   Upload and map images to [Realtimeboard](https://realtimeboard.com/hello/).
    *   Or just _email_ a photo.
10.  **Review the sketches and add notes** - Take a break and then come back to your sketches a while later. Take a look at them again. Does the sketch still make sense to you? A good sketch must be easy to follow.

![](https://assets.toptal.io/uploads/blog/image/121216/toptal-blog-image-1474978448447-40701c83cf93e9be6339d4f0af43109c.png)

> If you as the designer can’t understand something you have in your sketch, then the solution won’t be successful. Either the sketch doesn’t allow you to visualize your ideas well, or the ideas are too complex.

## Clarifying Sketches with Additional Elements

Find or draw a proper sketch, and then add the following details to it:

1.  **Title** - Sometimes adding a title is a good option. Write a description and date, if necessary, at the top of the sketch. The title will help you understand what you are looking at and whether or not the sketch is relevant. This is especially useful if you have a lot of sketches or you are going to show to others.

2.  **Annotations** - Annotations are names and notes placed close to an element, to explain its content or other attributes. They add details that clarify other elements, and are usually difficult to draw. For example, it could be the name of the block, some interaction details, an explanation of a picture, some ideas for future design variations, and so on. You can [check out one of my examples](https://www.toptal.com/uploads/blog/image/121195/toptal-blog-image-1474538721087-70346acafa1accafd4332e733179d551.JPG) to see what an annotation sketch looks like.

3.  **Numbers** - Number the elements of your sketch, or the sketches themselves. You can decide how to order them (e.g., by interaction flow, the order in which you created them, etc.). It may also be useful during discussions (especially remote discussions), as your colleagues and clients can just point out the sketch number in their feedback and you will understand which one their comments refer to.

4.  **Arrows** - You can use arrows to indicate screen transitions. They can also be used to connect different parts of sketches, to indicate a sequence of actions, and so on. Since the meaning of an arrow can vary, just above the arrow you can add a description or explanation of what the arrow is meant to signify. Here is an [example](https://www.toptal.com/uploads/blog/image/121197/toptal-blog-image-1474540322164-e4037ec1b56c685056935e3deaaaa8d7.png) of a basic sketch showing a transition and several difrerent states.

5.  **Notes** - Just like annotations, notes are used to explain concepts. However, notes differ from annotations in their placement. They are not attached to an element or located near the described element, [similar to this example](https://www.toptal.com/uploads/blog/image/121198/toptal-blog-image-1474540426961-bb0363f81ef0d15fbffd1fa7f1872e98.png). Notes can be placed at the top or bottom of the page. They can even describe elements that are not included in the design, questions that you may have, general explanations, unsketched ideas and so on.

6.  **Gestures** - Gestures are relevant in the case of touch device design. Drawing a hand gesture may require practice. There are several variants of gestures used to indicate different types of actions, so it is better to decide in advance how you designate a particular action (if it is not obvious, of course) and to practice drawing it.

7.  **Feedback** - You may receive suggestions for fixing or improving the sketch after showing it to others, or after you take another look at it yourself. It is often useful to mark such feedback in a different color so as to help differentiate feedback from the original sketch.

You can use different colors for different types of elements. Sometimes I use black for drawings, blue for links, dark green for notes, red for titles and feedback. Try to use different colors in your sketches, but make sure your choice of colors is consistent!

## More Specific Tips and Tricks

1.  **Don’t worry about the quality** - Don’t look at the sketches on Dribble; they are about something _completely different._ Bear in mind that the main purpose of sketches is to help you think clearer, find better solutions and save time.

2.  **Practice** - For a start, you can try to draw a few apps. Open a web or mobile app and try to copy the screen, describing the elements in the notes. Whenever you have some free time, practice drawing basic building blocks of your designs. In general, practice makes perfect. In a while, it will become part of your designer self.

3.  **Buy a folder** - I often don’t work from my office, but rather from a cafe or my home. Paper sketches are very prone to damage, so buy a simple folder to keep them safe and sound.

4.  **Bring tools with you wherever you go** - This helps ensure that you can capture your idea on paper at any time, otherwise you may just lose the thought or not be able to remember it in sufficient detail. I always have a notepad, a few A4 sheets, and pens with me.

5.  **Share with others** - It’s very important to engage other people and communicate with your team. Involving others and getting their feedback, especially early on, helps save time and resources in the long run. You can also encourage others to draw the way they envision the design.

6.  **Paper trays** - Think of placing paper trays on your worktable. For example, I have three of them: For incoming tasks, for sketches, and clean sheets of paper.

7.  **Experiment and customize** - My recommendations are based on my experience. In time, you’ll find out what suits you best; which methods, which sequence of steps, what exactly fulfills your creative potential. You will get there only if you constantly try something new, which is why it’s important to experiment with different formats, styles, and try new templates.

8.  **Use templates** - Templates will save time and implicitly take into account format restrictions, freeing up more time to focus on what is important.

## Additional Mini-methods to Improve Your Sketches

These aren’t necessarily tips and tricks, but they’re a collection of methods, tools, and suggestions that should boost your productivity or improve the quality of your sketches.

![](https://assets.toptal.io/uploads/blog/image/121218/toptal-blog-image-1474978640692-2c88d90d23aeb1b8484677f5fc3d4447.png)

1.  **Create a Sketch Board** - One of the biggest benefits of using pen and paper instead of a digital sketching tool is that you can actually stick it to a wall. Everyone on your team can see it and participate (although I recommend setting up review sessions).
    *   You will see your sketches yourself, and this will stimulate your thinking and let you see the big picture, not isolated pieces, but the whole system. You will see interactions between parts and the way they fit one another.
    *   Create the sketch board - attach your whiteboard sketches. If there is no whiteboard in your office, you can use double-sized adhesive tape or post-it note sheets to stick your sketches to the wall. If you don’t want to stick to the wall, you can find a big piece of cardboard paper instead. I strongly recommend using sketch boards, as they’re one of the best design tools.
2.  **Use a Whiteboard** - A whiteboard is a great drawing tool. It has a number of advantages: It is collaborative; it is easy to involve other team members in the discussion and in the drawing as well. Even if their ideas do not fit well, you will understand their way of thinking and it will help you to be on the same page.
    *   Markers do not let you focus on details, you have to think about the general things. Sketches are open to interpretation.
    *   A whiteboard is easy to clean and make corrections on.
    *   There is a lot of space and you can easily think through the whole system flow.
    *   You can attach sketches, printouts, and reference materials using magnets.
3.  **Prototypes** - Make a clickable prototype to evaluate your design. Try to get feedback about some elements. This works particularly well when you are using templates - your sketches are of the same size. Obviously, it will be much easier to draw same size sketches if you are using a template. I will try to make it even easier by providing you with a few templates you can download and use: [Mobile](https://toptal-email-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/71.pdf), [Browser multi-window](https://toptal-email-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/72.pdf), [Browser scroll](https://toptal-email-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/73.pdf), [Personas](https://toptal-email-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/74.pdf).

4.  **Use your Printer and Scanner** - Draw the framework by hand (you can use ruler to draw more accurately), then just scan it using a scanner or mobile app, and print it. You can edit your template in image redactor before printing. You can remove unnecessary details or duplicate some elements. You can also print a readymade site page, photos, and other descriptive elements. You can paste the cut-outs in your sketch.

5.  **Use Evernote for Scanning** - Evernote is a great design tool. You can keep and share your sketches in it, you can create themes, and use tags to organize your sketches. The abilities of the “Scanner” mode are particularly impressive. You put your sketch in front of it and it “scans” it, so you get the copy of the sketch. Then you can invite your colleagues to Evernote and give them your note link. Since there is a mobile app for tablets and phones, you can always have your sketches at hand.

6.  **Hybrid Sketching** - To put some life and realism into your sketches you can combine them with photos. That means that you have to take a photo and then draw some story with interface elements on it. This can also help you to notice some interaction issues and details.

7.  **Tracing Real World** - If you need to create a storyboard, illustrate an experience in a specific context (e.g. a person using a smartphone at a bus station), you need to include depictions of people, places, and various real-life objects. These can be difficut to draw, especially if you haven’t mastered drawing skills, but here’s simple tip:

> Take a photo of the object or the situation, and then obtain the key objects contour using an image editor. You can use the resulting contour in your sketches afterward.

Of course, if you have a _tablet and stylus_ it will be even easier.

## Wireflow: Outlining System Flow and Branching

The wireflow is essentially a sequence of the system flow, screen after screen, with branches and decision points. We should consider how a user addresses their task, the way they move from screen to screen, and their overall experience of the product over time.

![](https://assets.toptal.io/uploads/blog/image/121217/toptal-blog-image-1474978519495-3207145b04526cb6add52ae4214d3726.png)

Wireflow, or what you are drawing and the way it is connected, could be organized according to the following approaches:

*   **Sequence** - A sequence is a straight journey, screen after screen. It can also be a story with decision points; you show not only the journey but also decision points and different paths the user can choose. You can show the structure of screen interaction.
*   **State changes** - Depict different screen states of some element and the conditions or actions that cause the transitions between these states.
*   **Screen vs. screen elements** - You can draw the whole screens or consider micro-interactions and interactions.
*   **Platforms** - You can consider a one platform experience or multiple platforms.
*   **Scope** - Will you depict a part of the user journey or the whole journey? One user interaction with the system, or multiple users’ interactions?

I generally try to define the following wireflow types, depending on the organization and practical use:

![](https://assets.toptal.io/uploads/blog/image/121193/toptal-blog-image-1474530411596-b613d988b28bb8a092d6c814c2b22252.png)

1.  **Mapping overall flow and high-level flow** - Promptly sketch the screen shifts and draw the general journey of your product usage. Here you can include some context and you can optionally show some user interaction. For example, an e-commerce shopping service is quite a long journey that may include a lot of steps: How the user found the shop, the steps they went through to order the product, how they paid, and so on.

2.  **Screen flow** - This focuses on a specific functional flow through the system. It could be a small straight sequence of screens or a journey with branching. For example, a user uploading some photos or a video.

3.  **Navigation scheme** - Draw your screen and the options it contains. This is not supposed to map the journey. This step includes information that shows the options a user can choose, the directions users have, and various app parts. I usually create a navigation scheme at the beginning of a project. It serves to understand how navigation should be structured (what points should be included, how many levels are necessary).

4.  **Screen states** - Draw the screen or element states (an example might be a file upload dialogue). In this case, for example, the screen will have the following states:

    *   Blank
    *   A user pulls the file in the active area
    *   The file is uploading
    *   The file is uploaded
    *   There is an error

## Sketching UX Flow: A Quick How-To Guide

The wireflow design process is similar to the wireframe one. Many steps are similar or identical, but there are some important differences:

**Define what you need to draw** - Decide exactly what you want to draw (e.g. the general history or a fragment of your design). Do you want to generate different options or to think through the details of one journey? Decide whether you are going to show your sketches to someone else or not.

**Define what keyframes and transitions you should include in your drawing** - If you add all the screens and shifts your wireflow will be very long and complex. Consider which key screens you should show to convey the essence of the interaction that helps accomplish your task. The same goes for screen shifts. You need to choose which shifts will be more useful in expressing your idea. Check out [this example](https://www.toptal.com/uploads/blog/image/121199/toptal-blog-image-1474540975778-abea7a31986dfeacfda2e4e0804a2d1a.png) for reference.

**Define the starting point** - What will be the starting point of your journey? You can start with the entry point, i.e. the start of the journey, for example, what a user sees when they log into your app. Alternatively, you can start at the midpoint or with the most interesting/difficult/important screens or process steps. Or you can start at the end, with the end-result achieved by a user, and describe the steps the user took to come to this point.

![](https://assets.toptal.io/uploads/blog/image/121219/toptal-blog-image-1474978685103-a4d5fcf8c50aa59c80b738780c115757.png)

> Define your approach and make a general paper sketch.

**Decide what comes next** - After drawing the starting steps, decide what goes next by answering the following questions:

*   Which way does this step lead users?
*   Which way do you want them to go?
*   What do they have to do to get there?

**Sketch alternative routes, entries** - Think about alternative ways the user can get to each step:

*   What will happen if the user’s Internet connection fails?
*   What other options do they have?
*   What can go wrong in the case of user or app error, what will happen?
*   What will happen if the user closes the app at this step?
*   Where will the user start the next time he launches the app?

**Think about alternative flows** - Analyze the history, design an alternative flow, and sketch it.

**Add annotations, notes, details** - Add the explanatory elements that will clarify non-obvious details.

**Save** - Make a digital copy of the sketch.

**Share** - Share the sketch (e.g., via Evernote or Invision).

## Essential UX Flow Sketching Tips and Tricks

**Draft a wireflow first** - If you are going to think quite a long journey over, you would better make a quick sketch in order to understand how much space you need and in order not to miss some important steps or details. It would be difficult to add them to the paper sketch afterward.

**Don’t create a huge map with too many details** - Paper sketches don’t have an _undo_ button, so it will be difficult to make changes. You may draw the details too accurately and this will distract your imagination from the generation of different high-level variants. Instead of creating a huge scheme that would illustrate the entire system, try to focus on the key scripts and try to dedicate an individual page for each script.

**Cut unnecessary details and combine various detalization levels** - It is not necessary to draw all the interaction descriptions, so try to use only the key elements of your journey. While drawing a huge interactions map, you have no need to work every single screen out in detail. Some screens could be just represented by several squares, and other, key screens, could be worked out in detail.

**Try different paper sizes** - Try different paper formats, A3 or A5\. Paper sheet size will limit you and will affect your process in different ways. A small paper sheet will not let you add many screens or details, but it can help you to concentrate on the main ideas. Using a big paper sheet you can draw one huge journey, a lot of details and additional notes. Alternatively, you can place a number of small journeys on it.

**Post-it notes can help too** - You can also try to use Post-it notes. You can draw separate screens or some footnotes on them, or you can draw additional states of your sketch’s elements. Their advantage is that they can be easily replaced, you can also simply move the note somewhere else. For example, in case the flow has changed you can just change the order of your Post-it notes.

**Use templates** - Try to use templates. They will save time and will enable you to create more clickable, high-quality prototypes.

**Try using a whiteboard** - A whiteboard has a number of advantages. It is becoming more and more popular because it allows you to draw a huge journey with a lot of branches. You can draw a lot of application components on paper and then just attach them to the whiteboard using magnets, adding them to the journey.

**Sketching a shadow** - Shadows can help you to mark important elements and they add visual attractiveness to your sketch. I use [three different types of shadows](https://www.toptal.com/uploads/blog/image/121196/toptal-blog-image-1474539075108-6a873f9d5c92296581a899fc3e595e83.JPG)

*   Lines following the light direction - this does not always look beautiful, but you can use the graduation and pick the objects up to different “heights”
*   Outlining of some part out with a darker color (only the bottom or the bottom and right side)
*   Using the Pro-marker (or its equivalent in the app you use for drawing)

**Drawing components** - An objection like _“I can’t draw that well”_ may stifle your initiative. It is actually easier than it sounds. Even the most complex sketches are generally composed of a number of basic blocks, like in [this example](https://www.toptal.com/uploads/blog/image/121200/toptal-blog-image-1474541374928-3041b386060c7e598ac8ed9e07e47ace.JPG).

> If you can draw a point, a line, a triangle, a square and a circle, then you have the essential building blocks you need to draw anything for your sketch.

**Putting it all together** - The basic elements, buttons, radio buttons, and dropdowns are composed of basic elements. After learning to draw these elements, you can [combine them](https://www.toptal.com/uploads/blog/image/121201/toptal-blog-image-1474541497592-c88cfa0ae9df1bbd3229b7280cfd05c0.JPG) and draw complex blocks and components.

## Wrap Up

The goal of this post was not to create the ultimate, one-size-fits-all guide to UX sketching, or sketching in general, because designers have different needs and personal preferences.

As you can see, this is _a lot_ to cover. Designers use a myriad of tools, techniques, and approaches to produce UX sketches, and it’s rather subjective. Certain techniques may or may not work for different people working on different projects. If you’re just getting started, you should definitely experiment.

> Constant practice and experimentation will help you find what works for you.

It’s up to you to choose tips and techniques that will be the best fit for your project and your approach to design. Do you have any additional sketching tips for fellow [UXers](https://www.toptal.com/ux)? Feel free to share them in the comment section.
