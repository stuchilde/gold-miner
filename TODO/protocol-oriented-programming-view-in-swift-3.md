## Learn how to animate buttons, labels, imageView without creating bunch of classes

You‚Äôve heard knowledge without execution is like having teeth but only drinking milk. You ask, ‚ÄúOkay, enough of theories. How can I start using POP in my app?‚Äù ü§î

In order to drink the most juice out of your time with me, I expect my readers to understand `Completion Handlers`, and create basic implementation using Protocol. If you aren‚Äôt comfortable with them, I ask you to kindly *leave* and then watch some of my articles and videos below and *come back* after.

Prerequisite:

*No Fear Closures Part 2: Completion Handlers (*[*Medium*](https://medium.com/ios-geek-community/introduction-to-protocol-oriented-programming-in-swift-b358fe4974f#.koyj2ap8d)*)*

*Intro to Protocol Oriented Programming (*[*Medium*](https://medium.com/ios-geek-community/introduction-to-protocol-oriented-programming-in-swift-b358fe4974f#.koyj2ap8d)*)*

### What I think you will learn

You will learn how to use Protocol to **animate** UI Components such as `UIButton`, `UILabel`, and `UIImageView`. I will also show you the differences between traditional methods vs the POP way. üòé

### UI

The demo app called, ‚ÄúWelcome to My House Party‚Äù. I‚Äôve made this app to verify if I‚Äôve invited you to my house party. You have to enter your invitation code. **There is no logic behind this app. If you press the button, things will animate regardless.** There are four components that animate, `passcodeTextField`, `loginButton`, `errorMessageLabel`, and `profileImageView`.

There are two animations: 1. Buzzing 2. Popping (Flash)

Don‚Äôt worry about getting it down. Just flow like water with me for now. If you are impatient, just scroll, download the source code, and you may dismiss.

### Things Back Then

To fully grasp the power of POP in real apps, let‚Äôs compare with the traditional. Let‚Äôs say you want to animate `UIButton` and `UILabel`, You might subclass both and then add a method to it.

    class **BuzzableButton**: UIButton {
     func buzz() { // Animation Logic }
    }

    class **BuzzableLabel**: UIButton {
     func buzz() { // Animation Logic }
    }

So, let it ‚Äúbuzz‚Äù when you tap on the login button

    @IBOutlet wear var errorMessageLabel: **BuzzableButton!**
    @IBOutlet wear var loginButton: **BuzzableLabel!**

    @IBAction func didTapLoginButton(_ sender: UIButton) {
     errorMessageLabel.buzz()
     loginButton.buzz() 
    }

Do you see how we are **repeating ourselves**? The animation logic is at least 5 lines, and there is a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù way to go about using `extension`. Since `UILabel` and `UIButton` belong to `UIView`, we can add

    extension UIView {
     func buzz() { // Animation Logic }
    }

So, `BuzzableButton` and `BuzzableLabel` contains that `buzz` method. Now, we are no longer repeating ourselves.

    class **BuzzableButton**: UIButton {}
    class **BuzzableLabel**: UIButton {}

    @IBOutlet wear var errorMessageLabel: **BuzzableButton!**
    @IBOutlet wear var loginButton: **BuzzableLabel!**

    @IBAction func didTapLoginButton(_ sender: UIButton) {
     errorMessageLabel.buzz()
     loginButton.buzz() 
    }

### Okay, then why POP? ü§î

As you‚Äôve seen, the `errorMessageLabel`, which states, ‚ÄúPlease enter valid code üòÇ‚Äù also has one more animation to it. It appears and fades out. So, how do we go about with the traditional method?

There are **two ways** to go about this. First, you could, again, add another method to `UIView`

    // Extend UIView 
    extension UIView {
     func buzz() { // Animation Logic }
     func pop() { // UILabel Animation Logic }
    }

However, if we add methods to `UIView`, the `pop` method will be available to other UIComponents besides `UILabel`. We are inheriting the unnecessary functions, and those UIComponents become bloated by default or to emphasize, as f.

The second way is by subclassing `UILabel`,

    // Subclass UILabel
    class **BuzzableLabel**: UILabel {
     func pop() { // UILabel Animation Logic }  
    }

This works *okay. *However, we might want to change the class name to `BuzzablePoppableLabel` to indicate clearly just by looking at the name.

Now, what if you want to add one more method to `UILabel` to clearly indicate what the label does, you might have to change the class name to, like `BuzzablePoppableFlashableDopeFancyLovelyLabel`. This isn‚Äôt sustainable. Of course, I‚Äôm taking it pretty far.

### Protocol Oriented Programming

*Okay, you have come this far, and you haven‚Äôt recommended this article yet, gently tap that and continue.*

Okay, enough of subclassing. Let‚Äôs create a protocol first. Buzzing first.

*I didn‚Äôt insert code for animations since they are quite long, and gists aren‚Äôt natively supported by mobile apps.*

    protocol Buzzable {}

    extension Buzzable where Self: UIView {
     func buzz() { // Animation Logic}
    }

So, any UIComponents that conform to the `Buzzable` protocol would have the `buzz` method associated. Unlike `extension` only those who conform to the protocol will have that method. Also, `where Self: UIView` is used to indicate that the protocol should be only conformed to `UIView` or components that inherit from `UIView`

Now, that‚Äôs it. Let‚Äôs apply Buzzable to `loginButton`, `passcodeTextField`, `errorMessageLabel`, and `profileImageView` But, wait, how about Poppable?

Well, same thing.

    protocol Poppable {}

    extension Poppable where Self: UIView {
     func pop() { // Pop Animation Logic }
    }

Now, it‚Äôs time to make it real!

```
class BuzzableTextField: UITextField, Buzzable {}
class BuzzableButton: UIButton, Buzzable {}
class BuzzableImageView: UIImageView, Buzzable {}
class BuzzablePoppableLabel: UILabel, Buzzable, Poppable {}

class LoginViewController: UIViewController {
  @IBOutlet weak var passcodTextField: BuzzableTextField!
  @IBOutlet weak var loginButton: BuzzableButton!
  @IBOutlet weak var errorMessageLabel: BuzzablePoppableLabel!
  @IBOutlet weak var profileImageView: BuzzableImageView!
  
  @IBAction func didTabLoginButton(_ sender: UIButton) {
    passcodTextField.buzz()
    loginButton.buzz()
    errorMessageLabel.buzz()
    errorMessageLabel.pop()
    profileImageView.buzz()
  }
}
```

The cool thing about POP is that you can even apply `pop` to any other UIComponents without subclassing at all.

    class MyImageView: UIImageVIew, Buzzable, Poppable

Now, the name of the class can be more flexible because you already know available methods based on the protocols you conform, and the name of each protocol describe the class. So, you no longer have write something like, `MyBuzzablePoppableProfileImage.`

**Too long, didn‚Äôt read:**

No more Subclassing

Flexible Class Name

### Last Remarks

I hope you‚Äôve learned something new with me. If you have, please tap that ‚ù§Ô∏è to indicate, ‚Äúyes‚Äù. If you‚Äôve found this implementation useful, make sure **share** so that iOS developers all around the world begin to use Protocol Oriented Views to write fewer lines of code and modularize. Come back on Sat 8am EST!

### Swift Conference

[Andyy Hope](https://medium.com/u/99c752aeaa48), a friend of mine, is currently organizing one of the largest and greatest Swift Conferences at Melbourne, Australia. It‚Äôs called Playgrounds. I just wanted to help out with spreading the word. There are speakers from mega-billion dollar companies such as Instagram, IBM, Meet up, Lyft, Facebook, Uber. Here is the [website](http://www.playgroundscon.com) for more info.

I‚Äôve met David this week in Seoul, Korea. He needed some help with Bluetooth‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm like, ‚Äúüò®, let me try‚Äù.

#### Upcoming Course

I‚Äôm currently creating a course called, The UIKit Fundamentals with Bob on Udemy. This course is designed for Swift intermediates. It‚Äôs not one of those ‚ÄúComplete Courses‚Äù. It‚Äôs specific. Over 180 readers have sent me emails since last month. If interested, join me for free until released: bobleesj@gmail.com
