A few years ago, the software start-up GitHub faced an uncomfortable truth: It could be a pretty unpleasant place.

曾经，Github 有一个必须面对的现实是： 就是它可能会让用户感觉很不舒服。

It was 2014 and the company was growing rapidly as a hub for programmers to collaborate on coding projects. But as its user base grew, so too did its problems. A GitHub developer, Julie Ann Horvath, left the company amid searing [accusations of sexual and gender-based harassment](http://money.cnn.com/2014/03/17/technology/github-sexual-harassment/) (target=undefined), putting GitHub at the center of bad press for weeks and leading to the resignation of the company’s CEO.

作为一个程序员分享项目代码互相合作的网站，2014年是Github 网站发展最快的时候。 但是，随着用户数的增多，相应的，麻烦也变得越来越多。Julie Ann Horvath，一位在 Github 工作的程序员，就因为饱受性别歧视的折磨而离开了公司。

To make matters worse, GitHub soon realized such problems weren’t limited to the office. Bullying and discrimination ran rampant on the site. There was [systemic discrimination against women](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/12/women-considered-better-coders-hide-gender-github), with female coders often taken less seriously than their male peers. Petty disagreements devolved into flame wars in project comments. A bitter ex followed his former girlfriend from project to project, saying nasty things about her. And racist, sexist trolls sometimes co-opted features meant to enable collaboration to carry out vicious attacks, using, for example, a people-tagging feature to tag their targets on projects with racist names, transforming their portfolios into a slur of racist epithets.

更糟糕的是，不多久，Github 就发现这样不仅仅是他们内部的问题。辱骂和歧视在整个网站上都呈现一种蔓延的趋势。在整个社区上，都可以感受到一种对女性的歧视，女性并不如男性受重视。小小的不合就会演变成一场评论大战。一个分手的男人在他前任女生的每一个项目里，都说了一些不堪入目的话语。而那些性别主义，种族主义的喷子们，则利用那些原本为合作提供便利的特性，来攻击别人。比方说，利用标签来把一个人和一个用种族主意词汇命名的项目标记到起来，将这个人的项目集变成一系列的含糊不清的种族主义词汇。

Nicole Sanchez, the company’s VP of Social Impact, told that these are the “dangers and pitfalls of online life,” and not unique to GitHub, but GitHub wanted to try to prevent them.

Nicole Sanchez，公司社会影响部门的头头，发言说「这些都是网络自带的危险和隐患」，不仅是 Github 上有，Github 仍努力要消除它们。

It might surprise you that a website built for programmers to share code could become a hotbed of online harassment. But GitHub, valued at $2 billion, is a social network in nature, a combination of Facebook and LinkedIn for computer programmers, and involves a lot of user-to-user interaction. And along with that, on the internet, usually comes abuse.

很让你惊讶对吧？一个给程序员分享代码的网站竟会成为滋生不当言论的乐土。但 Github，这个估值两亿的网站，本质上仍然是一个社交网站，它是一个面向程序员的 Facebook+Linkedin 的混合体，所以必然包含了大量的人与人的互动。但只要互联网上有了它，往往就会被滥用。

Hoping to recover and heal its bruised image, GitHub hired Sanchez, who at the time had just [started Vaya](http://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/For-some-startups-tech-s-lack-of-diversity-is-6052546.php), a diversity consulting firm.

为了拯救自己的不好的形象，github 雇佣了Sanchez。Started Vaya 是一个专门咨询多元化的公司，而Sanchez 正是它的创始人。

“We want to connect every developer in the world, and to do that we need to build an inclusive community where everyone feels safe and welcome,” said CEO Chris Wanstrath.

"为了把全世界所有的程序员连结起来，我们首先需要营造个安全舒适的社区环境。" CEO Chris Wanstrath 说。

Sanchez got to work, revamping how the company approached everything from hiring and performance reviews to office decor. Since its beginning, the company had been non-hierarchical, with no managers or titles, but Sanchez helped to kill it, finding that without bosses, people weren’t held accountable when their actions were in the wrong. She tweaked internal processes to make the environment more diversity friendly, like by creating a formal feedback process for complaints. And she hired February Keeney, a half-Puerto Rican transgender woman, to lead a new Community and Safety team to attack the problem of harassment on the site.

Schaez 开始工作以后，重新安排了公司的诸多事务，从雇佣、绩效考核到公司的装饰。从一开始，Github 就是一个不分等级的公司，没有经理，也没有职称。但 Sanchez 停止了这个制度，因为她发现，如果没有管事的，那么人们也不会为他们的错误承担责任。她优先使得公司的内部环境对多元文化更友好，比方说建立一个官方的抱怨渠道。她还招进了February Keeney，一个有一半波多黎各血统的变性人，带领新成立的「社区安全组」去解决网站上的不当言论。

It was a difficult stance to take given the existing culture in Silicon Valley. GitHub, like so many tech companies, had long feared tamping down on what its users could say and do. Many techies feel that the internet is supposed to be open and free and that cracking down on even the most unseemly user behavior infringes on rights to free speech. Twitter, for example, had long refused to address its own problem with abuse, referring to itself as the “free speech wing of the free speech party.”

考虑到硅谷的文化，这是一个很难采取的立场。（p.s. 不知道「立场」前面应该搭配一个什么动词才好 =_=，求校对帮忙）Github，和许多技术公司一样，都害怕限制用户言论。许多做技术的人都觉得网络应该是一个开放且自由的地方。即便是处理那些最不当的言论，也损害了用户言论自由的权利。比方说 Twitter，一直都拒绝对其产品的在不当言论上的滥用而采取措施，而宣称自己是「自由主义里的言论自由的先驱」。

free speech wing of the free speech party. -> 不知道这句怎么翻译才好。

“People were so dogmatic about open source,” said Sanchez. “It meant that it has to be open all the time and accessible to everyone without question.”

「人们对于『开源』太教条了。」Sanchez 说，「人们总觉得『开源』意味着随时随地，并且无条件开放给任何人。」

Change-averse GitHub employees complained anonymously in the press that Sanchez was trying to “[to control culture](http://www.businessinsider.com/github-the-full-inside-story-2016-2),” but eventually she won most of them over.

那些不期望改变的 Github 雇员匿名在媒体上抗议说 Sanchez 试图控制 Github 的文化，不过最终，她还是取得了大部分人的支持。

“It’s not just that harassment is unpleasant,” Sanchez told me. “It’s that we were losing people.”

「那些污蔑不仅仅是让人不舒服。」Sanchez 说，「更重要的是，它使我们的用户总数在减少」

A 2014 [survey](http://fortune.com/2014/10/02/women-leave-tech-culture/) of women who had recently left the tech industry found that culture—including harassment—was a major factor in their decisions. GitHub viewed a diverse user base as essential to the company’s success and decided it needed to snuff out (断绝) harassment to achieve it.

2014年，一份报告调查了女性离开工业界的原因，其中，极客文化——当然包括了污蔑，诽谤和骚扰 —— 是她们离开的一个重要原因。用户的多样性是 Github 成功的重要原因，也正因为此，Github 决定要根除网上的各种不当言论。

GitHub didn’t just need a new code of conduct—it needed to consider how every tiny detail of its design might be exploited to harass. Trolls be damned.
GitHub 不仅仅是需要在内部执行一份新的行为准则，他需要考虑产品的各个方面，排除其中可能被用户用作诽谤的细节。该死的喷子们！

GitHub is not the only Silicon Valley company to have realized that ugly online behavior will not go away on its own. Two years ago, technology companies typically met calls to crack down on bullying with either a defense of free speech or a shrug. But [scandal](http://www.newsweek.com/ellen-pao-kleiner-perkins-john-doerr-buddy-fletcher-314293), [criticism](http://fusion.net/story/327103/leslie-jones-twitter-racism/) and [harassment horror stories](http://fusion.net/story/270090/sxsw-gamergate-science-and-the-internets-harassment-problem/) have forced a reconsideration of that approach.

Github 并不是唯一的一个意识到互联网上的丑陋行为不会自行消失的公司。两年前，这些技术公司在面临网络暴力的问题时，还常常以言论自由来为自己辩护，或者不予理会。但丑闻，批评，网络暴力，使得大家开始重新考虑这个做法。

When former Twitter CEO [Dick Costolo famously admitted](http://www.theverge.com/2015/2/4/7982099/twitter-ceo-sent-memo-taking-personal-responsibility-for-the) last February that “we suck at dealing with abuse,” it was a call to arms. Since then, Twitter and other companies have vigorously rolled out attempts at solutions. In September, Instagram announced a new feature allowing individual [users to block offensive words](http://fusion.net/story/347364/instagram-comment-moderation-policy/). This fall, [Google revealed](https://www.wired.com/2016/09/inside-googles-internet-justice-league-ai-powered-war-trolls/) it was building A.I. to combat internet trolls. Even the internet’s seedy underbelly, Reddit, has placed [bans on its most toxic](http://fusion.net/story/168376/reddit-will-still-allow-hate-speech-but-itll-be-slightly-harder-to-find/) quadrants.

去年二月，Twitter 的 CEO Dick Costolo 公开承认「我们在处理网络暴力这件事情上做的很差」，这是一次号召。从那时开始，Twitter 以及其他公司开始积极地尝试各种解决办法。九月时，Instagram 发布了一个新功能，允许用户屏蔽恶意词汇。今年秋，Google 暗示说它在开始构建 A.I. 来对抗网络暴力。甚至连最让人不爽的 Reddit，也封了他最不好的方面。

“There’s a general thing in the zeitgeist right now,” Julio Avalos, GitHub’s chief business officer, told me. “There has been a shift in what employees expect of their employers and what customers expect of companies. People are going to start voting with their feet.”

「现在有那么个一个浪潮」Julio Avalos，Github 的首席商务官，对我说，「现如今，雇员对雇主的期盼更高了，人们总会开始用脚投票的。」

![Julio Avalos, GitHub's Chief Business Officer.](https://i0.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/screen-shot-2016-11-14-at-12-28-03.png?resize=670%2C617&amp;quality=80&amp;strip=all)

Twitter is Silicon Valley’s cautionary tale of what happens when you ignore the zeitgeist. Over its decade of existence, Twitter has mostly ignored abuse, making it [a prime destination](https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/a-honeypot-for-assholes-inside-twitters-10-year-failure-to-s?utm_term=.ohBx6EKra#.dm0pE9yw6) for [trolls](http://womenactionmedia.org/cms/assets/uploads/2015/05/wam-twitter-abuse-report.pdf) and [hate](http://fusion.net/story/359668/twitter-anti-semitism-adl-report/). [High-profile users have fled the network,](http://fusion.net/story/327103/leslie-jones-twitter-racism/) citing harassment. As the embattled company has struggled to find a buyer in recent months, some have speculated that [Twitter’s harassment problem](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/18/did-trolls-cost-twitter-35bn) has played a role.

Twitter 便是忽略这股浪潮的反面教材。作为一个有十多年历史的老公司，Twitter 基本上对网络暴力视而不见，使他成为喷子和憎恶最爱去的地方。因为网络暴力，一些大 V 用户也离开了 Twitter。这家公司在最近几个月一直在寻找买家，有人猜测[Twitter的网络暴力]是一个重要原因。
Trolls have become the scourge of the internet era. The sad fact of the matter is that the internet is chock full of a**holes; something really ought to be done about it.
喷子们已经成了网络时代的祸害。可悲的是，互联网上已经充满了 **蛋，真的是应该需要做点什么的时候了。

But how do you rid the online world of violent verbiage and hatred when violence and hatred so thoroughly permeate the world itself? To use Twitter again as the unfortunate example, over the past two years it has [banned revenge porn](http://fusion.net/story/102264/twitter-bans-revenge-porn/), issued [new anti-harassment rules](https://blog.twitter.com/2015/fighting-abuse-to-protect-freedom-of-expression-0), established a [trust and safety council](http://thenextweb.com/twitter/2016/02/09/twitter-now-has-a-trust-and-safety-council-to-help-its-users-feel-safe/#gref) and [suspended](http://fusion.net/story/327536/milo-yiannopoulos-nero-permanently-banned-from-twitter/) high-profile users it considers abusive. And still, it seems, abuse has flourished.

但是，在现实生活中你都无法避免所有的暴力和辱骂，你要怎么在网络上避免他们呢？拿Twitter 来举例子吧。他们推行了……，……和……。但是网络暴力仍然在网上泛滥。(译注：省略号对应文中那三个政策)

“On Twitter,” BuzzFeed’s Charlie Warzel [wrote](https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/a-honeypot-for-assholes-inside-twitters-10-year-failure-to-s?utm_term=.awWPe3z94#.eeW97xOwg) earlier this year, “abuse is not just a bug, but—to use the Silicon Valley term of art—a fundamental feature.”

「Abuse 不是一个bug ，是feature. 」

There is no miraculous healing salve for an internet of hate.

治疗网络暴力并没有什么万能药的。

[Trolls are trying to get this teacher fired for protesting Neo-Nazis](http://fusion.net/story/319671/yvette-felarca-is-anti-neo-nazi/)

（译注：这段要翻译进去么？感觉是文章推荐诶 ）

“There is no end of ideas about solutions for online harassment,” said [Nathan Matias](https://civic.mit.edu/users/natematias), a researcher at MIT studying ways to reduce harassment and discrimination online. “There is a universe of possible outcomes, and right now we have very little evidence that any one solution will lead to the outcome desired.”

「网络暴力并没有什么一站式的解决方案」Nathan Matias，MIT 专门研究减少网络歧视和辱骂的研究员说，「可能的结果的非常多，现在能够证明我们能取得理想结果的证据却很少。」

When GitHub decided to crack down on harassment, it also decided to hire Coraline Ada Ehmke, a transgender women and, up until then, one of GitHub’s most vocal critics.

当 Github 下决心跟网络暴力一战到底的时候，它也招进了 Ada Ehmke，一个变性人，从那时开始，她就成了 Github 最重要的批评家。

Ehmke had been a victim of a glaring flaw in GitHub’s design. She was the author of the “[Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/),” a voluntary code of conduct adopted by many GitHub projects. Not everyone in the free-wheeling open-source community appreciated Ehmke’s contribution, though, and some users went after her. GitHub had no feature allowing users to opt out of being tagged by others and so bullies began tagging Ehmke as a contributor to made-up projects with racist names, marring her GitHub profile, a portfolio of all of her open-source work. It was as if someone had tagged a swastika across her resume then doled it out to future employers.

Ehmke 曾经是 Github 设计的受害者之一，她是 Contributor Covenant 的作者，一个许多 Github 项目都志愿遵守的准则。但并不是所有在自由意志的开源社区的人都欣赏她的贡献，有一些人开始攻击她。Github 没有任何功能允许用户选择不被标签，所以攻击者们开始讲 Ehmke 作为贡献者与种族主义名字的项目标记在一起，损坏她的 Github 个人主页 —— 一份记录了她所有开源项目的页面。看起来就像是有人把她和希特勒联系在一起，然后再兜售给他将来的雇主。（译注：swastika 这句话也是有点不知道怎么翻译）

![GitHub engineer Coraline Ada Ehmke.](https://i0.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/coraline_speaking.jpeg?resize=640%2C427&amp;quality=80&amp;strip=all)

“Harassers are very clever. They take advantage of tools that are very innocuous and use them as vectors for abuse,” Ehmke told me. “If you’re creating products and not thinking about how it could be used for abuse, you are not doing your job.”

「这些喷怎么是很聪明的。他们从各种工具中寻找便利，然后将其作为武器攻击别人。」Ehnke 说：「如果你从来没考虑过你的产品会如何被用来人身攻击，那你的工作是不到位的。」

When GitHub hired Ehmke last February as a senior engineer, some were outraged by the direction her hire suggested GitHub was headed.

去年二月，当 Ehmke 被雇佣为 Senior Engineer 的时候， 一些人因此感到很愤概，认为 Github 会因此被毁。（译注：some were outraged by the direction her hire suggested GitHub was headed.—— headed 不知道这里何解。）

> [@CoralineAda](https://twitter.com/CoralineAda)[@github](https://twitter.com/github) So you are going to ruin Github just like the SJWs are ruining Twitter?
> 
> — Jon (@42zarf) [February 25, 2016](https://twitter.com/42zarf/status/702704096499912705)

“At the start of my career, I had a lot of male privilege,” Ehmke told me. “Intellectually I knew that things like this happened, but until I transitioned I really didn’t fully understand. Open source is not very welcoming to people who are not male or white.”

「我刚开始工作的时候，作为男性，我有很多优势。」Ehmke说，「尽管我一直都知道存在这样的事情，但是直到我变性之后，才开始真正理解那些人。开源社区对于非男性或者非白人一直都很不友好。」

Everyone I spoke with at GitHub underscored that the most important step in addressing harassment and diversity on GitHub was first solving those problems within the company itself.

每个同我在 Github 谈过话的人都强调说，要解决 Github 上的网络暴力，首先是应该要解决公司内部的自己的问题。

“If there is not diversity at the front end of the funnel there is no ability to be able to deliver diversity to your customers on the other side,” Avalos, who is Guatemalan and joined GitHub in its boss-less era, told me. “We don’t want to have blinders to things in the product that are alienating people.”

「如果我们自身一开始就不是多元化的，我们又如何能将这种多元化传递给用户？」Avalos，危地马拉人，在 Github 还没有老板责任制的时候就加入了公司，对我说，「我们不希望对那些疏远用户的产品视而不见。」

The Community and Safety team, made up of six people, includes two people who identify as transgender, four as women, three as people of color, and two “token white men.” It is, in other words, a lot more diverse than your average Silicon Valley engineering team.

社区和安全小组由六个人组成，包括两个变性的人，四个女性，三个为有色人种和两个“象征白人”，换句话说，比起一般的硅谷团队更「多元化」。

Their job isn’t just to build new anti-harassment tools, but to vet new GitHub features and anticipate how they might be used for abuse.

他们的工作不仅仅是构建新的「反网络暴力的工具」，也包括诊断各种 Github 的功能，预测他们会如何被用来诽谤。

“We’re not just an engineering group at GitHub,” Ehmke told me. “We’re considered critical infrastructure. At GitHub, these things are as important as keeping the lights on.”

「在 Github 里，我们不仅仅是一个工程师团队。」Ehmke 对我说：「我们被认为是关键的基础设施，在 Github，这些事情被认为和保持灯光一样重要。」

The biggest change the team has made is asking GitHub engineers to build “consent and intent” into the platform. Users should have the right to consent to being tagged by another user for example. That would have prevented Ehmke’s racist tagging experience. So GitHub tweaked the project-tagging feature to require user approval.

团队迫使 Github 做出的最大的改变就是要求 Github 的工程师们在平台中建立「同意和意向」。比如，用户有权利同意被一个用户标注。这可以阻止类似于 Ehmke 的种族主义标签的事件再次发生。所以 Github 调整了用户标记功能，需要用户批准。

“We don’t want to have blinders to things in the product that are alienating people.”

「我们不打算对产品中疏远人的部分视而不见。」

Intent, though, is trickier. Not every person who says something that sounds offensive on GitHub intends to actually say something offensive. “You suck” can be a mean-spirited jab or a playful joke between friends.

但主观意图是一个很微妙的事情。在 Github 上说一些听起来很冒犯的话并不一定说明那个人是想骂你。「You suck」既可以被当中一个中性的鼓励短语，也可能是朋友之间的一句完全而已。

“We realized that harassing behaviors really fall into two buckets,” said Keeney. “There is the intentional bigot. And then there is the person who, like, tells Asian driver jokes without realizing they are racist.”

「我们意识到，不当言论其实分为两类」Keeney 说，「一类就是故意的，而另一类，就像那些开地图炮的一样，根本没有意思到自己的种族主义。」

GitHub needed a way to handle offensive behavior with more dexterity and nuance.

Github 需要找到更灵活的方法来处理这些行为下面的细微的差别。

Last month, the company released a proposal for [community guidelines](https://github.com/blog/2267-introducing-github-community-guidelines). It included rules for [banned behavior](https://help.github.com/articles/github-community-guidelines/#what-is-not-allowed)—doxxing, discrimination and bullying—and spelled out clearly what constitutes those behaviors. There are [consequences for breaking the rules](https://help.github.com/articles/github-community-guidelines/#what-happens-if-someone-breaks-the-rules), from content removal to account termination.

上个月，公司发布了一条「社区指导」的草案。它包括[禁止行为]的规则（https://help.github.com/articles/github-community-guidelines/#what-is-not-allowed） - 辱骂，歧视和欺凌 - 并清楚地阐明了什么构成那些行为。 还有[破坏规则的后果]（https://help.github.com/articles/github-community-guidelines/#what-happens-if-someone-breaks-the-rules），从删除内容到帐户终止不等。

Being GitHub, it has asked its community for feedback. One user looked at the proposed guidelines, and suggested its ban on pornography shut out projects that might have to do with sex education or reproductive health. Ultimately, the best way to meet community needs, GitHub decided, is to ask for the community’s help.

而作为 GitHub，它已要求其社区提供一些反馈。 一个用户看了看拟议准则，并建议其将色情也拒之门外，包括一些可能与性教育或生殖健康相关的项目。 最终，GitHub决定，满足社区需求的最佳方式就是请求社区的帮助。

Moderating comments, for example, might be a job better shared by both GitHub and open-source project managers better equipped to tell if a potentially offensive joke actually offended.

例如，审核评论这个特性，如果被用户和开源项目的管理者所共同管理可能会更好，这样更容易发现那些潜在的冒失的笑话。

“Right now, the only options moderators have are to delete comments, report an issue to us or block a person from their project,” Keeney said. “But we want to make sure that we offer a range of tools for moderators to respond to problems. A range of problems requires a range of responses.”

「现在，管理者唯一能做的就是删除评论，举报或者在一个项目中禁止某人。」Keeney 说，「但我们希望确保我们为管理者提供一系列工具来应对问题。不同的问题需要不同的反应。」

Eventually, Keeney told me, GitHub plans to roll out a variety of tools that will let project managers do things like ban a troublesome member for just a few days.

最后，Keeney告诉我，GitHub计划推出一系列工具，可以让项目经理做更多的事情，比如禁言一个问题成员仅仅几天的时间。

GitHub’s approach has three central tenets: design features to make hassling other users more difficult, empower users with tools to help safeguard themselves, and enlist the community to help keep everything under control.

GitHub的做法有三个核心原则：在功能的设计上使骚扰其他用户更加困难；提供新的工具以帮助用户保护自己；争取社区帮助以使一切尽在掌握。

So far, the company said, it’s been successful. Blocks and reports of incidents have gone up, indicating that GitHub users are actually using the site’s new tools. And when incidents do occur, the time it takes to respond to user reports has gone down. 

据 Github 表示，到目前为止，整个策略已经相当成功了。 阻拦和报告的恶意事件数增加了，表明用户实际上正在使用网站的新工具。 另一方面，当恶意事件真正发生时，响应用户所需的时间减少了。

“The more we can put tools in the hands of users to manage their own experience, the better.”

「我们赋予用户管理自己体验的权利越多，结果越好。」

Other online communities are embracing similar tactics. The subreddit r/science transformed its embattled comment threads into civil discourse by establishing clear community rules and rallying an army of more than 1,300 moderators to enforce them.

其他在线社区也在采取类似的策略。Reddit 上的 r/science 就建立明确的社区规则，并征集了约1300人的来维护这些规则，成功的将充满火药味的帖子变成了民主讨论。

“Any reasonable approach to governing online behavior will ask users to do at least some work to govern communities,” Matias told me. “When communities take on this work, we often get more accountability and responsiveness.”

「任何合理的治理在线行为的方法都至少要求用户做一些工作来管理社区，」Matias告诉我。 「当社区开展这项工作时，我们通常会获得更多的责任感。」

Instagram and Twitter, too, have recently shifted toward giving users more ability to deal with abuse themselves. In November, Twitter [unveiled a new feature](http://fusion.net/story/370271/twitters-new-harassment-tools/) allowing users to mute specific words and phases from appearing in notifications.

Instagram 和 Twitter，最近也开始想用户提供更多的处理不当言论的能力。11月，Twitter 发布一一份新特性，允许用户从通知里屏蔽某些单词和短语。

“The forms that abuse can take can vary tremendously,” Del Harvey, Twitter’s VP of Trust and Safety told me. “It is unrealistic that we will be able to predict everything people will consider harassing. The more we can put tools in the hands of users to manage their own experience, the better.”

「网络暴力的形式有许多种。」Del Harvey，Twitter 的信任与安全部门的副总裁对我说。「我们不可能提前预测到所有的用户会让用户不舒服的言论，我们赋予用户管理自己体验的权利越多，结果越好。」

Not every space on the internet has to be squeaky clean.

网络上的不是每一个地方都需要非常干净

“There need to be spaces on the internet with different social norms,” said Amy Bruckman, a researcher at Georgia Tech who studies online communities. “There should be online spaces that are a little more rough and tumble. That’s okay as long as they are open about what they are and don’t cross a line that’s actually dangerous.”

「网络上的不同地方，需要不同的社交模式。」乔治亚理工学院的一个研究在线社区的研究员 Amy Bruckman 说，「网络上也应该有一些不那么光鲜的地方，」

In other words, it all comes back to rules. Just like the real world, there are different spaces for everyone. Maybe Reddit is your neighborhood dive bar, and Facebook your corner coffeeshop. We can all agree that what happens in a dive bar at 4 a.m. is not always appropriate in a coffee shop.

换句话说，这都取决于规定是什么。就像真实的世界一样，不同的人会去不同的地方。Reddit  是你家旁边的diva bar，而 Facebook 是街角的咖啡厅。我们都知道，在4点的酒吧发生的事情，不可能发生在咖啡厅里的。 

In the end, the most important shift in how companies approach harassment is that they’re willing to lose troublesome users.

最后，这些公司做的最大的改变就是，他们愿意失去一些有问题的用户。

Voicing different points of view and opinions is necessary to foster communication across ideologies. People randomly yelling “bitch!” is not. But finding a balance isn’t easy. At GitHub, new hires and rules have resulted in significant backlash. Not everyone is happy. But GitHub could care less. In the end, the most important shift in how companies approach harassment is that they’re willing to lose troublesome users.

发表不同的见解是不同意识之间互相交流的一部分。而对人骂 "bitch" 却不是。 但是，找到他们之间的平衡却很难。在 Github 上，新雇佣的雇员和新发布的规定都给社区造成了严重的冲击。并不是每个人都会因此开心，但 Github 现在只需要操心在更少的用户上面了。最后，这些公司做的最大的改变就是，他们愿意失去一些有问题的用户。

“If they don’t like the culture we are trying to create, disgruntled users have other options,” Nicole Sanchez told me. “It is okay for us to draw a line.”

「如果你不喜欢我们新创造的关键，你大可选择别的地方去」Nicole Sanchez 对我说，「对我们来说，我们不介意和你划清界限。」
