# Why Design

# 为何而设计？

The best presents I received growing up came from my uncle who lived in Japan.

我成长中收到的最好的礼物来自于生活在日本的叔叔。

Once every year or two, he’d appear in his tweed suit and thick glasses for a brief visit with our family. He didn’t have kids and he didn’t seem to know much about them, so his interactions with me were limited to pats on the head or a firm handshake. But he was well-to-do at a time when our family was still clawing through student loans, and he always came bearing gifts from the magical land of super-skyscrapers, shimmery-eyed cartoon characters, and my favorite food group: ramen.

每隔一两年，他都会穿着那件粗花呢的西装戴着厚厚的眼睛来我家探短亲。他没有孩子而且好像也不了解孩子，所以他和我之间的互动就仅限于拍拍头或者握手。在他富裕的时候我们一家还在学生贷款中挣扎，他总是会从日本给我们带礼物过来，那片土地充满了摩天大楼、眼睛雪亮的卡通人物还有我最喜欢的食物：拉面。

Our family’s first digital camera was gifted by him. So was this smooth, brick-sized pastel yellow box containing the most exquisite collection of tiny office supplies you’ve ever seen — a stapler the size of my thumb, a small vial of clear glue, an eraser-sized tape measure, and an elegant pair of scissors — each sitting within its own felt-lined nook and displayed as immaculately as jewels. I have never loved office supplies so deeply, and I likely never will again.

我家的第一台数码相机就是叔叔送的。叔叔还送过一个光滑的砖头大小的分黄色盒子，里面装满了你所见过的最精美的办公用品收藏——一个拇指大小的订书机、一小瓶透明胶水、一卷橡皮擦大小的卷尺和一把造型雅致的剪刀——它们都安静地排列着，像完美无瑕的珠宝。我从未这样深爱过办公用品，并且也可能以后也不会再有了。

But no gift compares to the one I received when I was eleven or twelve. I was sitting in the living room reading, minding my own business when my uncle came in and wordlessly handed me a package that changed my life.

但是没有礼物比得上我在十一二岁的时候所获得的礼物。当时我正在卧室看书、思考自己的事情，叔叔走了进来默默地递给我一个改变人生的包裹。

It was a Sony walkman.

那是一台索尼随身听。

*Hold up*, you say. *What’s the big deal?* Everyone had a Sony Walkman growing up.

**等等**，你或许会说。**那又怎么了？**每个人长大的时候都有一台索尼的随身听。

Ah, but not *this* Sony Walkman. Not one from the Motherland itself, a model I’ve never seen in the U.S., all sleek curves and cool metal. Not in *this* shade, which I called yellow at the time, but which was brighter and grassier than any yellow I’d ever seen. I didn’t have the vocabulary for it then, but I do now. The damn thing was *chartreuse*.

哈，但是那并不是**这款**随身听，不是来自祖国（这里指日本，译者注）的，拥有我从未在美国见过的款式，有着光滑的曲线和凉爽的金属质感的随身听，不是这种渐变色，我当时叫作黄色，但是比我见过的黄色更亮更绿。我当时并不知道怎么形容，但是现在我知道了，那种颜色被称为“淡黄绿色”。

It was the most magnificent thing I’ve ever owned, and not just because it played my recorded-from-the-radio mix tapes. Its every detail was, in my mind, flawless.

那是我拥有过的最具意义的东西，并不仅仅因为它能播放我从电台中录下的混合磁带，在我看来，它的每一个细节都是那么的完美无瑕。

I’d thumb over its cool, metallic surface every night as I fell asleep listening to my favorite Jocelyn Enriquez song. I’d marvel at its beautiful metal hinges, as intricate as the inner workings of a clock, every time I popped it open to switch tapes. Its size was smaller than all the other Walkmans (Walkmen?) I’d seen, barely larger than the cassette tape itself and perfect for a jacket pocket. The shiny chrome buttons along the top were a pleasure to press. The headphones came with their own volume controls, which I thought was the coolest thing ever. And in a stroke of sheer genius, the Walkman came with a twistable add-on that could hold a single AA battery to extend play life.

每个晚上我都会抚摸着它凉爽有着金属质感的外壳，听着我最喜欢的 Jocelyn Enriquez 的歌声入眠。每次换磁带的时候，我都会惊讶于它那美丽的金属铰链简直和钟表机芯一样复杂。它比我看到的其他随身听都要小，仅仅只比磁带大一点，正好能装进夹克的口袋中。按上面那些光滑的铬金属的键简直是一种享受，而我认为最酷的事情要数它的耳机上自带线控了。还有一个惊为天人的设计，随身听上有一个可旋转的插件能够装下一节 AA 电池来延长播放时间。

> There have been many, many objects in my life that I have appreciated. That have done what I’ve hoped they would do, that have saved me time and made me pause in admiration for their beauty.

> 生活中有许多许多我赞赏的东西，它们实现了我的目的，节省了我的时间也让我停下来欣赏他们的美丽。

There are few that have completely blown me away because they were so far and away better than anything I could have imagined.

但是几乎没有让我完全折服的东西，因为他们比我想象的差太远了。

This was my experience with my Walkman. Music was incredibly important to me at that time in my life, and I could imagine no better conduit to connect me with my life’s soundtrack. Plus, it was so far and away better than anything my friends had that I felt like the coolest kid in school.

那是我和我的随身听的故事。那时，音乐在我的生命中的重要程度令人难以置信，我想象不到更好的能够连接我和生命的乐章的工具。另外，它比朋友们的随身听都要好得多，这让我觉得我是学校中最酷的孩子。

Even back then, I’d sometimes stare up from my bed, earphones plugged in, wondering about the people who built it. Who were they, and what kind of magic did they possess to create a thing that mattered so much to me?

即使在那是，我也常常在床上凝视着上方，带着耳机，想象创造它的人。他们是谁，用了怎样的魔法才创造出了对我如此重要的东西？

One of the side effects of being a teenager obsessed with computers is that you become saddled with all the technical chores in the house. This is despite my mom being a computer programmer by profession.

成为沉迷于电脑的青年的一个副作用就是你将承担起家里所有的技术活，即使我妈是专业的电脑程序员也不例外。

“Julie!” she’d call the morning after Daylight Savings. “Don’t forget to reset all the clocks in our house! Including the one on the VCR!”

Or

“Julie! Can you help me erase this tape and record a new show over it?”

Or

“Julie! I need to make some copies of these photos. Can you put them on a CD-ROM?”

“Julie！”她会在刚刚破晓的早上就打电话来，“别忘了充值家里的钟表，包括 VCR 上的！”

或者

“Julie！你能帮我清掉这盘磁带然后重新录音吗？”

或者

“Julie！我需要这些照片的副本，你能拷贝到 CD-ROM 上吗？”

I’d retort that my mom was perfectly capable of doing it herself, but she’d always offer excuses. One, that she was afraid of messing it up. Two, that it would take her forever because she wasn’t as tech-savvy as me. Three, couldn’t I do a thing or two that was helpful without grumbling about it?

我会反击她完全有能力自己完成，但是她总有各种理由。一、她害怕把事情弄砸了，二、那会耽误她很久因为她没我这么有技术天分，三、难道我就不能毫无怨言地做一两件有意义的事么？

I’d set the clocks, program the VCRs, burn the CDs. I’d roll my eyes and complain, but to be honest, doing these things made me feel special. They were complicated tasks, and yet I mastered them with ease.

所以我要调整钟表、VCR，烧录 CD，我会翻白眼也会抱怨，但老实说做这些事情让我感觉到自己与众不同。这些都是很复杂的工作，但是我却驾轻就熟。

I wore my badge with pride. I was one of the *tech-savvy* ones.

我很自豪地给自己戴上奖章，我是其中一个**技术天才**。

What does the word *designer* connote?

**设计师**意味着什么呢？

A certain focus on visual beauty, on the way the space flows between two descenders, on the tucked-in lines of a handsome armchair, on the precise curves of that metallic casing?

A certain steadfast *knowing* in the gut*, *of what is simple and lovely?

A certain intuition for how others might feel as they approach this object or dwelling or experience, borne through years and years of sensing and seeing?

A certain effortlessness of dress — stark neutrals and thick rims on a sophisticated silhouette?

What kind of identity have we wrapped into such a word?

是一种特定的对视觉美关注，比如两行字母的间距、漂亮的扶椅的线条、金属外壳的曲线？

是一种特定的对简单可爱的事物**本质**的深刻**理解**？

是一种特定的通过多年来的见闻和感受产生的对于事物的直觉，其他人在接触它、或者犹豫或者经历的时候会产生何种感受？

是一种驾轻就熟的装扮——比如在复杂的轮廓中使用完全的素色和厚重的边缘？

In my senior year of college, I was assigned to read *The Design of Everyday Things* by Don Norman. There is a famous passage where he talks about the design of doors. Imagine that a door has a u-shaped handle but is labelled with the word *PUSH*. What would you do?

大四的时候，我被指派（可能是课堂作业，译者注）阅读 Don Norman 的*The Design of Everyday Things*（日常用品的设计）。他在一个非常著名的通道曾讨论过关于们的设计，试想一下，一个装有 U 型把手的门，却贴着**推**，你会怎么做？

Well, half the people would try pulling, because that’s what the handle seems to beckon. *Pull me! I am a u-shaped handle!* And when the door doesn’t budge, they may feel a flicker of irritation. *Is this thing broken? What’s going on?* Then, when they see the sign, it might dawn on them that they’re doing it all wrong. *Oh, *they think with a mild sense of foolishness.

约一半的人会去试着拉门，因为那是门把手在暗示他们：**赶快拉我！我是一个 U 型门把手！**。但当门并不能被拉动的时候，他们可能就面带愠色了。**这玩意儿坏了吗？怎么回事儿？**然后，他们才看到标志提示他们做错了。他们会觉得自己有点犯傻了。

We’ve all encountered these kinds of Norman doors. Most of the time, we internalize the tension. *I should have read the sign*. *I’m not using this right. I’m not tech-savvy enough. I might mess it up. It’s too hard to learn. It will take me forever*.

我们都遭遇过这种诺曼式的门，很多时候，我们内心都略有紧张，**我应该先看标志的**，**我做错了，我不够聪明。我搞砸了。这太难学了。我一辈子也学不会。**

*The Design of Everyday Things* made me see a different perspective.

*The Design of Everyday Things* 给了我一种不同的视角

**It’s not my fault.**

**那不是我的错**

Why should anyone be made to feel like an idiot when the design of the thing is what’s broken?

明明是设计出了问题，却为什么让人觉得是自己蠢呢？

When you *find* a solution, what do you think of? Peering through a magnifying glass or emerging from a maze? The notion of meandering around lost until — lo and behold! A shimmer on the ground! Could it be the missing piece we were looking for?

当你在**寻求**解决方案时，你会怎么想？通过放大镜寻找或者它自己会从迷宫中浮现？摸着石头过河，直到你情不自禁地笑出来，看到那点星星之火！那是我们正在苦苦寻找的光明吗？

When you *engineer* a solution, what comes to mind? Gadgets and gears? A stroke of cleverness late one night as the rest of the world sleeps, a flurry of hours spent rigging up a precise contraption until it does something we’ve never seen before?

当你**实现**解决方案时，你会想到什么？小工具和齿轮？夜深人静时的灵光一现？紧张工作几个小时搭建一个精妙地装置来实现我们迄今闻所未闻的功能？

When you *design* a solution, what pops into your head?

当你**设计**解决方案时，你大脑中会出现什么？

Here is my answer: that we considered and explored. That we peered ahead into the stress test of the real world, when some harried young woman minding her own business encounters our work. She’s not thinking of us, she’s thinking of what she has to do that night — an e-mail to write to her professor, a midterm to cram for, laundry to do in preparation for that party on Saturday. And we were prepared for her. We left no detail unexamined.

这是我的答案：我们要深思熟虑并且不断地探索。假如我们对设计进行真实世界里的压力测试时，正好遇到一名行色匆忙心无旁骛的年轻女孩。她不会想到我们的，她只想着她接下来要做的事——给教授发邮件、准备期中考试、洗衣服准备周末的聚会。而且我们需要为她做好万全准备，无微不至。（意为设计门把手的时候应该为顾客考虑，译者注。）

At a minimum, we meet her expectations. There are no frowns, no flickers of irritation. She sails through those doors and continues with her life.

至少，我们要达到她的期望，不让她皱眉、面起愠色。她能顺利通过那些门然后继续做该做的事。

At best, we catch her attention. She pauses and allows herself a moment of wonder for our work. It’s more than she expects, and so she will remember it with fondness.

最好，我们能吸引她的注意。她会停下来然后思考，我们的设计让她很意外，所以她会牢牢记住。

> To design is to be intentional about the outcome we want.

> We who plan and construct and build, we are all designers.

> 设计即是策划我们想要的结果

> 那些计划、架构和建造的人，都是设计师。

I don’t have my chartreuse Walkman anymore.

我已经没有我那黄绿色的随身听了。

If I were the sentimental kind, I would have kept it for the nostalgia, like some people do with old record players or rotary telephones.

如果我是那种多愁善感类型的人，我将会把它留作纪念，像其他人保留着老式的录音机或者手摇电话机一样。

The truth is, we humans are always craving the next big thing. Nothing blows our minds forever. We marvel at it, and then it’s our new normal. It becomes what we expect.

事实上，我们都渴望未来的东西，没有事物能永远让我们折服。我们一开始感到惊奇，之后就对它习以为常了，于是我们开始对它有了期待。

I gave up my beloved Walkman for an ugly plastic Discman. It wasn’t a hard decision. Comparing the very best cassette player in the world with a CD player is like putting the best foot soldiers in an arena with armored calvary. There is no competition. Having to spend many seconds rewinding or fast-forwarding to get to a particular song doesn’t stand a chance against one-press access.

我为了一个丑陋的塑料的光碟随身听放弃了钟爱的随身听。这并不是一个艰难的决定，世界上最好的卡带随身听跟 CD 播放器比起来，就像是把最好的步兵放到装甲骑兵中一样，根本没有可比性。需要若干秒来回退或者快进来得到一首特定的歌曲在一键切换面前根本不屑一击。

In some ways, this knowledge is bittersweet. Nothing gold can stay. You make a thing that changes the world, and before long the world has changed to the thing. It no longer inspires the same kind of wonder. Given time, we will always demand more.

某些方面，这道理是苦乐参半的。韶华易逝。你创造了一个可以改变世界的发明，不久，世界改变了，而它也不会像当初一样那么令人赞赏了。假以时日，我们总是得不到满足。

And yet, I remain an optimist.

但是，我还是持乐观的态度。

I think all designers must be.

我认为所有的设计师都要这样。

If you believe it’s not your fault that you’re confused, if you feel “the tech-savvy one” is a shitty concept, if you think anyone in the world should be empowered to do anything, then you believe we can design it better.

如果你也相信感到困惑不是你的错，如果你也感觉“有天分的人”是一个很扯淡的观点，如果你也认为世界上每个人都有能够做些什么，那么你就是相信我们能够设计地更好。

Somewhere out there is a young girl who is staring up at her ceiling, her mind ready to be blown.

某个地方，正有个女孩盯着天花板，她已经准备好被某些东西所折服了。

We can design it better. And so we will.

我们能设计得更好，我们来了。
