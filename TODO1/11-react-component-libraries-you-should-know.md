# 11 React UI Component Libraries you Should Know in 2019

Although still behind Angular in the [sheer numbers](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#technology) of users, React is leading in popularity in Stack overflow’s most loved component libraries:

React is rising in popularity in 2017

React’s virtual DOM, the ability to declaratively describe a user interface and model the state of that interface, low barriers to entry for a decent Javascript developer, all make React a great [go-to library](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/yes-react-is-taking-over-front-end-development-the-question-is-why-40837af8ab76) for building UI’s.

Another great reason for working with React is components. Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces. To help kickstart your work with React components, here are 11 great React component libraries to use.

You can also combine these components with [Bit](https://bitsrc.io) to turn your components into building blocks which can be organized and synced in multiple projects.

- [**Bit - Share and build with code components**: Bit makes it fun and simple to build software with smaller components, share them with your team and sync them in your...](https://bitsrc.io "https://bitsrc.io")

With Bit, you can easily share, develop and sync components from multiple projects and applications, organize them for your team and improve your workflow for React components with 2–way code changes, creating a distributed dev workflow. Here is [an example](https://bitsrc.io/bit/movie-app).

### Individual components

Individual components can be found in the popular [awesome-react](https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react) and [awesome-react-components](https://github.com/brillout/awesome-react-components) projects. You can also add [Bit](https://bitsrc.io/) to any repository or library to track and isolate components within it. Then, these components can be exported directly from any path in the repo in seconds and any developer can then install them with NPM/Yarn and make changes from any project.

As it seems, in 2018 the popularity of React will continue to rise and its components will grow to become the modular building blocks of more of the apps we use every day.
