0:00	hello everybody welcome to our next

0:02  session here and I'm really really

0:10  great talk on what it is to be a Python

0:17  my friend here maryada we yaha we see I

0:27  we won't be having any Q&A; afterwards

0:33  talk with you during the rest of the

0:37  be around so without further ado Mario

0:49  top so before I introduce more about

0:55  here will will all be here in the same

1:01  good that we all know each other more so

1:06  use Python right you have written at

1:12  use f strings yes and you're all here

1:18  you're here at PyCon meeting interacting

1:23  member of the community and and I

1:29  the community by contributing to open

1:34  least made one pull request to any open

1:40  lot of you there's a lot of you that's

1:44  much for contributing to open source and

1:48  alright Who am I now I am really busy

1:57  Mary era and now you can find me on

2:02  children two sons seven and five years

2:08  I now live in Vancouver I work for

2:13  I want to thank SAP year for completely

2:18  at PyCon all they ask is I wear the

2:26  we're hiring so check out check us out

2:31  too and I'm outside of my family and

2:37  ladies

2:41  PI Cascades so the next one will happen

2:49  of all that I I do contribute to open

2:53  me I just really started doing that two

2:59  it comes to open source so but last year

3:06  to see Python I can now call myself a

3:16  all about this like since I became a

3:20  questions like what even is a Python

3:25  can they become a core developer so to

3:32  for future generations I'm just gonna

3:36  I can point them to this video next time

3:43  gonna borrow this diagram which I saw it

3:49  Russell Keith McGee's keynote speech he

3:54  funnel so he described it as follows

3:59  could potentially use your project some

4:03  your project and start using a project

4:07  and becomes a regular user some of the

4:12  participating in a community becoming

4:16  members start contributing to the

4:20  the contributors stick around long

4:23  team and some of the core teams becomes

4:26  I copied it McGee and he talked really

4:37  start with this diagram except I'm gonna

4:44  has been more like climbing up the

4:49  instead of going down like that

4:56  potential users or new users let's just

5:02  and in place of the leader we have to be

5:10  they also become the leaders of the

5:15  of that later but this is how I felt my

5:21  used Python and then I started getting

5:27  conferences I went to PyCon I went to

5:31  to open source and eventually they gave

5:37  team members and I think that's where

5:43  will replace him he will be around

5:52  what is a Python core developer

5:59  the commit right to see Python and

6:06  whole world this programming language

6:11  people with such commit writing comes

6:19  this cool Python logo next to my name in

6:27  Python language submit free admission

6:30  and it happens every year at PyCon us

6:36  prints and uh it seems to be happening

6:41  an annual tradition but it comes with

6:50  granted commit right you will be added

6:57  you will be added you will be

7:03  obviously the C Python the Deaf guide

7:10  all our github BOTS you'll be expected

7:17  Python mailing lists Python runs our

7:24  thousands of emails I have thousands of

7:29  inbox is full I have to figure out today

7:36  manage your emails I said that you'll be

7:43  responsibilities what I meant is that

7:50  to review a lot of for requests today

7:56  you're going to have to make decisions

8:01  or said no and in the past year core

8:10  for requests that's a lot of work and

8:17  you've gotta be prepared to face the

8:24  fine it was the right decision usually

8:29  wrong decision that it actually breaks

8:36  the person who merged the poor requests

8:43  be responsible and follow up and try to

8:48  so it's a huge responsibility and then

8:57  people to contribute to cpython because

9:02  what you expect and since you have the

9:08  you get to make decisions you get to

9:15  not you get to shape the language decide

9:25  responsibility and that makes you the

9:34  language and the community yes there's

9:42  decisions but he takes input from the

9:48  he delegates many things to the core

9:53  these to happen and core developers make

9:56  so we're his helpers well his

10:02  the leaders of this community so now

10:08  core developer is people still have lots

10:14  answer them one by one this is one of

10:21  user or somebody I just met asked how

10:31  a really big question it's difficult

10:38  going to try to answer some really easy

10:44  involved in the community this is really

10:51  be involved anyone can take part you

10:58  Meetup I run meetups I know we're always

11:04  for people to speak give workshop teach

11:10  your local meetup organizers tell them I

11:17  you can host made ups help them out and

11:21  start one if you don't like to do

11:27  fine you can just write blogs about

11:33  use Python write about your favorite

11:38  the knowledge of Python to everyone

11:44  way to contribute back to the community

11:50  conferences rely on volunteers and

11:58  members of the community always always

12:04  and respectful next question how to

12:15  join the communication channels join

12:19  Ayana see kitaru slack just get to know

12:25  maintainer help by reporting issues tell

12:31  encounter propose new ideas help with

12:39  every projects I've participated in

12:45  documentation review pull request and

12:50  contributors always be open be a good

13:00  usually after I answer all that the next

13:08  actually I just want to contribute to

13:15  start with me

13:18  code tell me how all right I guess

13:26  to contribute to codes

13:32  to code you have to first rate the

13:38  has one everyone every project has

13:43  have to up first read that and then find

13:50  learn how to use version control like

13:59  then the follow-up question through this

14:04  developer please be more specific and

14:11  python this is this is the biggest

14:17  I I wanted to know this too I asked this

14:24  two years ago and so I'm just going to

14:33  dev guide it really has everything you

14:38  how to get the source code how to use

14:44  run tests how to compile everything he

14:50  it and then next he told me join the

14:58  list and if I ever need had ever have

15:03  is that just tell them Guido sent you

15:09  really the first few emails I wrote to

15:13  it started with hey I asked Widow about

15:20  here is my question then he pointed me

15:28  supposed to find issues to work on and

15:36  patch patch at a time pull requests now

15:44  sounds like it and he never really

15:51  he never assigned anything to me because

15:55  so that was something that I had to

16:03  to updates to the bug tracker

16:09  activities and then I try to read some

16:16  and then start researching and figure

16:28  people that start asking me well since

16:33  maybe you can find me an issue to work

16:43  in order to really find an issue I have

16:49  recent some of the issues that I thought

16:54  still ask you whether you're interested

16:58  interested so I think I feel that this

17:06  skill you're going to have to acquire to

17:14  shouldn't be relying on me or maintainer

17:21  work like that

17:28  I've been contributing what are my open

17:34  inspiration for examples except I really

17:42  contributions

17:48  was one of my first contribution to open

17:53  started two years ago I really fix a lot

18:05  fixing really the moral of the story is

18:17  like I was it wasn't intentional but it

18:23  the docs trying to learn how to use it

18:33  very little code to see Python and

18:39  everybody expects core developers to be

18:45  don't I write documentation I write to

18:53  bought right even more code than I have

19:01  iPhone 3 6 4 or 3 6 5 you're likely

19:09  and I I participate in mailing list help

19:16  pull requests I try to prioritize

19:22  contributors because I want to be the

19:28  pull request to see Python so that's

19:36  and there are lots of open-source

19:42  help

19:46  I contribute to Colin

19:51  couple months ago I use github and a

19:57  contributing them to really like look at

20:06  contributing them don't be fixated in

20:12  are a lot of open source projects now

20:20  Python they they all have the same

20:28  PR I'm sorry I'm really sorry that I

20:38  now let me share you some numbers since

20:47  have more than 65,000 pull requests we

20:55  days I think we merged 5200 the thing is

21:01  there are so many people contributing

21:10  even though there are close to 90 core

21:17  active in the last year so we just don't

21:26  I'm really really sorry

21:31  to not having enough time sometimes it's

21:37  should be reviewing it I think it's

21:40  review that's why I haven't review it or

21:46  it sounds bad I just didn't care it's

21:54  didn't ask for this change you went

22:00  sorry and i know i when i want to read

22:07  you why i am rejecting it but a lot of

22:14  want it I don't I'm sorry that I find it

22:24  to the next core developer to review

22:32  I'm sorry I'm also Canadian so and as

22:44  comes with certain consequence and I

22:52  responsibilities again sorry okay let's

23:00  question how to become a Python core

23:07  hardly involve multiple stages but I've

23:14  the community and how to start

23:19  the responsibilities of Python core

23:28  into smaller questions this is a much

23:38  see Python become a Python core

23:45  somebody to be a core developer we have

23:57  this person

24:02:00  commit right to see Python you will be

24:06:00  used by seven million people and if you

24:15:00  to earn our trust and there is no other

24:23:00  other than actually interacting with you

24:30:00  of you contributing you're participating

24:36:00  you review pull requests for us the more

24:42:00  the more we know you the more we can

24:50:00  then you're going to have to accept all

24:57:00  above all we do need to know that you're

25:05:00  open considerate and respectful to other

25:11:00  contributors now a lot of people then

25:22:00  did you earn the trust how did you

25:29:00  know don't don't ask me I I I really

25:34:00  to ask to other core developer at v--

25:40:00  squid or a snake as Brad Raymond they

25:48:00  don't I really just feel lucky how much

25:59:00  time then I'm willing to admit so I

26:08:00  source so in the past two months I've

26:12:00  I'm not contributing until the end of

26:18:00  when I'm at PyCon and at the spring

26:32:00  me this and it always feels like a trick

26:39:00  couple days ago here at this conference

26:45:00  ya I was asked when I was at PyCon

26:49:00  curious no I don't I don't get paid to

26:57:00  my salary is zero and as the core

27:07:00  few core developers are getting paid

27:14:00  not full-time they still put in a lot of

27:24:00  mystery how do i balance all of this III

27:34:00  forget a lot of things I keep forgetting

27:39:00  appointments and I double booked

27:45:00  have my life all balanced I don't know I

27:54:00  questions but I ask this question every

28:05:00  question the VFL asked me this question

28:13:00  to open source

28:24:00  Python has seven million users and I'm

28:29:00  users and our communities is diverse

28:38:00  women participating I see lots of people

28:41:00  I see disabled people I see

28:48:00  this conference and I think we've done a

28:55:00  the contributors to cpython

29:01:00  contributors in the last year a lot of

29:16:00  women no 10% 10 individuals we have a

29:37:00  I let the shock wears off because this

29:53:00  not the right representation of our

30:03:00  qualities you should not try to achieve

30:12:00  of statistics in your own organization

30:21:00  putting this out there so that you can

30:31:00  year I see a gap a really huge gap and I

30:41:00  I need help I really don't know what I

30:51:00  myself how to get more women

30:56:00  if people know of another large open

31:02:00  that is doing good with diversity tell

31:08:00  know and I I care so much about this I

31:18:00  sharp and I've explained to them the

31:25:00  advice and what can I pass on core

31:34:00  the community so they gave me some

31:43:00  problems and they also told me that it's

31:50:00  I'm going to need all the corners to

32:01:00  identifying problems I really had to ask

32:16:00  are the bearings that applies only to

32:25:00  contribute to cpython and only so few

32:35:00  for me personally I've I faced the same

32:43:00  here but one of the barriers was I

32:55:00  anyone who looked like me

33:03:00  time I believed it's just maybe I

33:09:00  the place for people like me and it it

33:18:00  overcome and I just feel so lucky that

33:26:00  the BDF algorithm and my son core

33:31:00  supporting me helping me throughout this

33:39:00  all but we we have to do better and the

33:46:00  they've acknowledged that there is still

33:56:00  during the language summit few days ago

34:01:00  to take part

34:05:00  they're going to have to do at least one

34:11:00  provide mentorship prioritizing women

34:16:00  they could try to set up office hours

34:24:00  them understand that public forums like

34:32:00  for women and minorities to ask

34:40:00  going to have to be available to answer

34:48:00  levels have been very receptive they are

34:54:00  to try to be more welcoming to women and

35:03:00  more I could have done to help improve I

35:10:00  privately my DM is always open six

35:17:00  sharing more of my experiences I thought

35:25:00  could inspire me maybe it could inspire

35:31:00  I've done anything spectacular I fix

35:38:00  then I will try so oh my my name is Mary

35:47:00  really want to hear my stories you have

35:51:00  will be sharing my stories if you wanna

35:56:00  when I have really really long stories I

36:02:00  is all thank you so much for listening
