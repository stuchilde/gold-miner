Google I/O 2018 is just a week away, and Flutter will be showing up in style at the event, with sessions, codelabs, office hours, an interactive sandbox space, and more. This is how to stay up to date with all-things Flutter from May 8–10th regardless of where you’ll be.

To get involved in discussions with other developers about Flutter and I/O, be sure to participate in one of the various global [I/O Extended events](http://google.com/io/extended) near you. If you’re interested in hosting your own viewing party, we’d [love to promote it](https://events.google.com/io/extended/form/).

Anyone can get involved this year: at home, at the event, or at an I/O Extended gathering. Be sure to share your Flutter experiences with #Flutter on Twitter.

See you next week!
